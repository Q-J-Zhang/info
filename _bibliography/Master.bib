  abstract = {Microrobots have the potential to dramatically change many aspects of medicine by navigating through bodily fluids to perform targeted diagnosis and therapy. Researchers have proposed numerous micro-robotic swimming methods, with the vast majority utilizing magnetic fields to wirelessly power and control the microrobot. In this paper, we compare three promising methods of microrobot swimming (using magnetic fields to rotate helical propellers that mimic bacterial flagella, using magnetic fields to oscillate a magnetic head with a rigidly attached elastic tail, and pulling directly with magnetic field gradients) considering practical hardware limitations in the generation of magnetic fields. We find that helical propellers and elastic tails have very comparable performance, and they generally become more desirable than gradient pulling as size decreases and as distance from the magnetic-field-generation source increases. We provide a discussion of why helical propellers are likely the best overall choice for in vivo applications.},

  abstract = {Abstract--- A hybrid walking neuroprosthesis that combines functional electrical stimulation (FES) with a powered lower limb exoskeleton provides therapeutic benefits of FES and torque reliability of the powered exoskeleton. Moreover, by harnessing metabolic power of muscles via FES the hybrid combination has a potential of lowering power consumption and reducing actuator size for the powered exoskeleton. Its control design, however, must overcome the challenges of actuator redundancy due to the combined use of FES and electric motor. Further, to maintain stability and control performance when disparate dynamics of FES and electric motor are combined, dynamical disturbances such as electromechanical delay (EMD) and muscle fatigue must be considered during the control design process. In this paper, a general framework to coordinate FES of multiple gait-governing muscles with electric motors is presented. A human motor control-inspired synergy-based control framework is used to derive the controller and is motivated mainly to address the actuator redundancy issue. Dynamic postural synergies between FES of the muscles and the electric motors were artificially generated through optimizations and result in key dynamic postures when activated. These synergies were used in the feedforward path of the control system. A dynamic surface control technique, modified with a delay compensation term, is used as the feedback controller to address model uncertainty, the cascaded muscle activation dynamics, and EMD. To address muscle fatigue, the stimulation levels in the feedforward path were gradually increased based on a model-based fatigue estimate. A Lyapunov-based stability approach was used to derive the controllers and guarantee their stability. The synergy-based controller was demonstrated experimentally on an able-bodied subject and person with an incomplete SCI.},

The bead subjected to magnetic and hydrodynamic forces is first modeled as a nonlinear control system. Then, a backstepping approach is discussed in order to synthesize a feedback law ensuring the stability along the controlled trajectory. We show that this control law, combined with a high gain observer, provides good tracking performances and robustness to measurement noise as well as to some matched uncertainties.},

Previous lower limb models are based on severely limited data describing limb muscle architecture (i.e., muscle fiber lengths, pennation angles, and physiological cross-sectional areas). Here, we describe a new model of the lower limb based on data that quantifies the muscle architecture of 21 cadavers. The model includes geometric representations of the bones, kinematic descriptions of the joints, and Hill-type models of 44 muscle--tendon compartments. The model allows calculation of muscle--tendon lengths and moment arms over a wide range of body positions. The model also allows detailed examination of the force and moment generation capacities of muscles about the ankle, knee, and hip and is freely available at www.simtk.org .},

  abstract = {This article deals with the stability properties of a continuous-discrete Riccati differential equation. The main motivation comes from the theory of Kalman filters for continuous-time nonlinear systems with sampled measurements, where this type of equation often arises. Stability is to be understood in the following sense: under appropriate hypotheses, the solution matrix is always symmetric positive definite and bounded from above and below. No uniformity is expected from the sampling procedure, only an upper bound on the elapsed time between consecutive samples is needed. The exposition consists of two parts. First, the stability properties are proven and second, by means of three examples, it is shown how the article's main result applies.},

  abstract  = {We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the solution of the time-invariant Riccati differential equation to converge towards the strong solution of the corresponding algebraic Riccati equation, when the system is stabilizable, without assuming that the Hamiltonian matrix has no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis (or equivalently that there are no critical unobservable modes). The condition is a generalization of an earlier one established by Callier and Willems. Our proof revises an earlier one by Faurre, Clerget, and Germain, leading to additional information of what can be assumed without loss of generality in our context. It is also shown that the convergence is not always exponential and that the presence of critical unobservable modes may slow down but does not prevent the convergence of the solution of the Riccati differential equation. The impact of the condition on linear-quadratic optimal control is briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 1995 Academic Press, Inc.},

  abstract = {The goal of this chapter is to provide tools for analyzing and controlling nonholonomic mechanical systems. This classical subject has received renewed attention because nonholonomic constraints arise in many advanced robotic structures, such as mobile robots, space manipulators, and multifingered robot hands. Nonholonomic behavior in robotic systems is particularly interesting, because it implies that the mechanism can be completely controlled with a reduced number of actuators. On the other hand, both planning and control are much more difficult than in conventional holonomic sys- tems, and require special techniques. We show first that the nonholonomy of kinematic constraints in mechanical systems is equivalent to the controllability of an associated control system, so that integrability conditions may be sought by exploiting concepts from nonlinear control theory. Basic tools for the analysis and stabilization of nonlinear control systems are reviewed and used to obtain conditions for partial or complete non- holonomy, so as to devise a classification of nonholonomic systems. Several kinematic models of nonholonomic systems are presented, including examples of wheeled mobile robots, free-floating space structures and redundant manipulators. We introduce then the dynamics of nonholonomic systems and a procedure for partial linearization of the corresponding control system via feedback. These points are illustrated by deriving the dynamical models of two previously considered systems. Finally, we discuss some general issues of the control problem for nonholonomic systems and present open-loop and feedback control techniques, illustrated also by numerical simulations.},

A$\backslash$nsound field in the liquid causes the gas volume to pulsate alternately$\backslash$nexpelling and drawing liquid through the open end of the tube. According$\backslash$nto general fluid mechanical principles, the liquid exits the tube$\backslash$nas a jet, while it enters it from the entire solid angle available.$\backslash$nAveraged over a cycle, this flow pattern results in a net source$\backslash$nof momentum which, by reaction, exerts a force on the tube. Possible$\backslash$napplications include the self-propulsion of the tube, a pump and$\backslash$na rotary actuator. Thereby a single device can be made to respond$\backslash$nto different frequencies, for example, switching the direction of$\backslash$nthe force by changing the sound frequency. The acoustic power required$\backslash$nis well below biologically hazardous levels, which would permit,$\backslash$namong others, powering the device remotely through living tissue.},

  abstract = {We present an untethered, electrostatic, MEMS micro-robot, with dimensions of 60 {\&}mu;m by 250 {\&}mu;m by 10 {\&}mu;m. The device consists of a curved, cantilevered steering arm, mounted on an untethered scratch drive actuator (USDA). These two components are fabricated monolithically from the same sheet of conductive polysilicon, and receive a common power and control signal through a capacitive coupling with an underlying electrical grid. All locations on the grid receive the same power and control signal, so that the devices can be operated without knowledge of their position on the substrate. Individual control of the component actuators provides two distinct motion gaits (forward motion and turning), which together allow full coverage of a planar workspace. These MEMS micro-robots demonstrate turning error of less than 3.7{\&}deg;/mm during forward motion, turn with radii as small as 176 {\&}mu;m, and achieve speeds of over 200 {\&}mu;m/sec with an average step size as small as 12 nm. They have been shown to operate open-loop for distances exceeding 35 cm without failure, and can be controlled through teleoperation to navigate complex paths. The devices were fabricated through a multiuser surface micromachining process, and were postprocessed to add a patterned layer of tensile chromium, which curls the steering arms upward. After sacrificial release, the devices were transferred with a vacuum microprobe to the electrical grid for testing. This grid consists of a silicon substrate coated with 13-{\&}mu;m microfabricated electrodes, arranged in an interdigitated fashion with 2-{\&}mu;m spaces. The electrodes are insulated by a layer of electron-beam-evaporated zirconium dioxide, so that devices placed on top of the electrodes will experience an electrostatic force in response to an applied voltage. Control waveforms are broadcast to the device through the capacitive power coupling, and are decoded by the electromechanical response of the device body. Hysteresis in the system allows on-board storage of n=2 bits of state information in response to these electrical signals. The presence of on-board state information within the device itself allows each of the two device subsystems (USDA and steering arm) to be individually addressed and controlled- . We describe this communication and control strategy and show necessary and sufficient conditions for voltage-selective actuation of all 2{\textless}sup{\textgreater}n{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} system states, both for our devices (n=2), and for the more general case (where n is larger.).},

The reason for the problems is subtle and is discussed, together with the reason why the proper account of nonholonomic constraints is outside the scope of Hamilton's variational principle. However, linear velocity constraints remain within the scope of D'Alembert's principle. A careful and comprehensive analysis facilitates the resolution of the puzzling features of nonholonomic constraints.},

  abstract  = {This work studies the dynamic relationship between the electrical activity produced in skeletal muscles and recorded using electromyogram(EMG), and torque at the healthy human ankle during isometric contractions. Subjects were instructed to voluntarily modulate their ankle torque by tracking a pseudo-random visual command signal. Impulse response functions (IRF) estimated between the EMG and torque records had an unphysiological anticipatory component suggesting that the estimated IRF was biased because the data were recorded in closed-loop. Applying a closed-loop identification algorithm that modeled the EMG-torque relation as a nonparametric impulse response function, and the noise as an autoregressive-moving-average process gave unbiased results. The EMG-torque IRF had second-order, low-pass, dynamics, whose properties varied with the mean torque.},

Research and development into biomimetic AUVs (BAUVs) is growing in order to overcome the problems of AUVs. A BAUV testbed is being developed. Our BAUV testbed is composed of several links and joints. We develop a local control law that coordinates body angles by periodically alternating the position of the center-of-mass in the local coordinate. We have found that three parameters are sufficient to coordinate joint angles to perform the carangiform swimming. We then develop a global control law for the way-point tracking problem. The effectiveness of this method is evaluated by computer simulation. Control performance of the BAUV system with model uncertainties to track way-points under the influence of disturbances is also discussed.},

It has a pair of fins and a floatage adjuster.$\backslash$nCharacteristics of the underwater microrobot are measured by changing$\backslash$nthe frequency and amplitude of input voltage. The experimental results$\backslash$nindicate that the swimming speed of the proposed underwater microrobot$\backslash$ncan be controlled by changing the frequency of input voltage, the moving$\backslash$ndirection (upward or downward) can be controlled by changing the$\backslash$namplitude and the frequency of input voltage},

  abstract  = {In this paper a Vehicle State Estimator is developed and validated on experimental data from a 2012 Toyota Prius. The estimator is capable of estimating both planar vehicle velocities and the tyre-road friction parameter. Emphasis is placed on the comparison of the commonly used Extended Kalman Filter and a novel application of the State Dependent Riccati Equation technique. The State Dependent Riccati based estimator relies on a factorization compared to linearization in the case of the Extended Kalman Filter. This factorization is non-unique, therefore the construction of this factorization, is also presented. A comparison is for both estimators is presented for experimental data. For estimation of the tyre-road friction parameter, simulations are used, due to absence of a reference value in the experimental set-up.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop an analytical set of equations to describe the motion of discrete dynamical systems subjected to holonomic and/or nonholonomic Pfaffian equality constraints. These equations are obtained by using Gauss's Principle to recast the problem of the constrained motion of dynamical systems in the form of a quadratic programming problem. The closed-form solution to this programming problem then explicitly yields the equations that describe the time evolution of constrained linear and nonlinear mechanical systems. The direct approach used here does not require the use of any Lagrange multipliers, and the resulting equations are expressed in terms of two different classes of generalized inverses—the first class pertinent to the constraints, the second to the dynamics of the motion. These equa-tions can be numerically solved using any of the standard numerical techniques for solving differential equations. A closed-form analytical expression for the constraint forces required for a given mechanical system to satisfy a specific set of nonholonomic constraints is also provided. An example dealing with the position tracking control of a nonlinear system shows the power of the analytical results and provides new insights into application areas such as robotics, and the control of structural and mechanical systems.},

  abstract  = {An Inertial Gait Phase Detection system was developed to replace heel switches and footswitches currently being used for the triggering of drop foot stimulators. A series of four algorithms utilising accelerometers and gyroscopes individually and in combination were tested and initial results are shown. Sensors were positioned on the outside of the upper shank. Tests were performed on data gathered from a subject, sufferer of stroke, implanted with a drop foot stimulator and triggered with the current trigger, the heel switch. Data tested includes a variety of activities representing everyday life. Flat surface walking, rough terrain and carpet walking show 100\% detection and the ability of the algorithms to ignore non-gait events such as weight shifts. Timing analysis is performed against the current triggering method, the heel switch. After evaluating the heel switch timing against a reference system, namely the Vicon 370 marker and force plates system. Initial results show a close correlation between the current trigger detection and the inertial sensor based triggering algorithms. Algorithms were tested for stairs up and stairs down. Best results are observed for algorithms using gyroscope data. Algorithms were designed using threshold techniques for lowest possible computational load and with least possible sensor components to minimize power requirements and to allow for potential future implantation of sensor system.},

  abstract  = {The new areas of technical exploitation of robotics systems has recently set new trends for the robotic actuation by demanding more versatile systems which can cope with unpredictable interactions within not well defined environments and work in close vicinity with the human. Following these trends, this work presents the development of a new actuation system with embodied characteristics such as passive compliance and variable physical damping. Compared to the other existing compliant linear or rotary actuators the proposed CompAct unit has the ability to regulate the oscillations induced by the introduction of the compliance by means of a variable physical damping actuator (VPDA) unit. Apart from facilitating the control the VPDA unit can assist in managing the energy transfer from/to the compliant module. The mechatronics, model and control scheme of the CompAct are analysed. The overall system is evaluated with experimental trials performed using a prototype unit. Preliminary results are presented to show that the unit and the proposed control scheme are capable of regulating the impedance components (stiffness and damping) within a wide range and with good fidelity.},

  abstract = {Bubbles in liquids, soft and squeezy objects made of gas and vapour, yet so strong as to destroy any material and so mysterious as at times turning into tiny light bulbs, are the topic of the present report. Bubbles respond to pressure forces and reveal their full potential when periodically driven by sound waves. The basic equations for nonlinear bubble oscillation in sound fields are given, together with a survey of typical solutions. A bubble in a liquid can be considered as a representative example from nonlinear dynamical systems theory with its resonances, multiple attractors with their basins, bifurcations to chaos and not yet fully describable behaviour due to infinite complexity. Three stability conditions are treated for stable trapping of bubbles in standing sound fields: positional, spherical and diffusional stability. Chemical reactions may become important in that respect, when reacting gases fill the bubble, but the chemistry of bubbles is just touched upon and is beyond the scope of the present report. Bubble collapse, the runaway shrinking of a bubble, is presented in its current state of knowledge. Pressures and temperatures that are reached at this occasion are discussed, as well as the light emission in the form of short flashes. Aspherical bubble collapse, as for instance enforced by boundaries nearby, mitigates most of the phenomena encountered in spherical collapse, but introduces a new effect: jet formation, the self-piercing of a bubble with a high velocity liquid jet. Examples of this phenomenon are given from light induced bubbles. Two oscillating bubbles attract or repel each other, depending on their oscillations and their distance. Upon approaching, attraction may change to repulsion and vice versa. When being close, they also shoot self-piercing jets at each other. Systems of bubbles are treated as they appear after shock wave passage through a liquid and with their branched filaments that they attain in standing sound fields. The N-bubble problem is formulated in the spirit of the n-body problem of astrophysics, but with more complicated interaction forces. Simulations are compared with three-dimensional bubble dynamics obtained by stereoscopic high speed digital videography.},

  abstract  = {This paper addresses the adaptive fuzzy tracking control problem for a class of uncertain nonlinear MIMO systems with the external disturbances. The adaptive fuzzy controllers are designed under the constraint that only system output is available for measurement. Then, it is needed to design a state observer to estimate the unmeasured states. In the observer design procedure, two prominent advantages are that it does not require the sign of the control gain coefficient to be known and only two parameters need to be adjusted on-line for each subsystem. By using Lyapunov analysis method, it is proven that all the signals in the closed-loop system are guaranteed to be bounded and the system outputs track the reference signals to a bounded compact set. The feasibility of the proposed approach is validated by using two simulation examples.},

  abstract   = {Functional electrical stimulation (FES) can improve walking in individuals with mobility impairments. We evaluated accelerometers, force sensitive resistors, segment angles, and segment angular velocities to identify which sensor best determines the activation and deactivation times of the main muscles used during walking. This sensor(s) can be used in the future in conjunction with FES systems to improve walking. Able-bodied subjects walked at various speeds. Threshold levels were set for each sensor that minimized the difference between the times of activating and deactivating the electromyogram (EMG) of six muscles and the times of sensor threshold crossings as a percent of the step cycle. Mobility-impaired subjects walked at their preferred speed with and without FES to correct foot drop. Thresholds were set for these subjects so that sensor signals would cross at times that matched those of able-bodied subjects. Segment angles were generally the most effective sensor signals. Using segment angles of the thigh, shank, and foot, activation and deactivation times of the six muscles could be determined to within 6\% of the step cycle. The shank segment angle produced the lowest overall error and was among the top three sensors for 10 of the 12 events (activation and deactivation of six muscle groups). A segment angle sensor was implemented using a complementary filter (accelerometer/gyroscope combination). Using this sensor improved rule-based timing of FES in subjects with foot drop as compared to accelerometers alone.},

  abstract  = {There is increasing interest in using robotic devices to assist in movement training following neurologic injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. This paper reviews control strategies for robotic therapy devices. Several categories of strategies have been proposed, including, assistive, challenge-based, haptic simulation, and coaching. The greatest amount of work has been done on developing assistive strategies, and thus the majority of this review summarizes techniques for implementing assistive strategies, including impedance-, counterbalance-, and EMG- based controllers, as well as adaptive controllers that modify control parameters based on ongoing participant performance. Clinical evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of different types of robotic therapy controllers is limited, but there is initial evidence that some control strategies are more effective than others. It is also now apparent there may be mechanisms by which some robotic control approaches might actually decrease the recovery possible with comparable, non-robotic forms of training. In future research, there is a need for head-to-head comparison of control algorithms in randomized, controlled clinical trials, and for improved models of human motor recovery to provide a more rational framework for designing robotic therapy control strategies.},

  abstract  = {Mathematical models have been developed to predict fatigue during functional electrical stimulation, but the predictive accuracy at different muscle lengths is unknown. The objectives of our study were to: (1) experimentally determine the relationship between knee extension angle (20 degrees, 40 degrees, 65 degrees, and 90 degrees) and fatigue of the quadriceps muscles, and (2) predict that relationship using a mathematical model. A computer-controlled stimulator sent trains of pulses to surface electrodes on the thighs of five subjects while forces were measured at the ankle. A two-component mathematical model was developed. One component accounted for force, and the other accounted for fatigue. The model was fit to the data, and parameters were identified at 90 degrees . The fitted subject-averaged r(2) value was 0.89. The model was used to predict fatigue at the remaining angles, and the subject-averaged r(2) values were {\textgreater}0.75. Therefore, at least 75{\%} of the variability in the measurements was explained by the model. The force model is explicitly dependent on angle, and the fatigue model is explicitly dependent on force; therefore, the dependence of fatigue on knee angle was implicit.},

  abstract  = {A general-purpose system to obtain the kinematics of gait in the sagittal plane based on body-mounted sensors was developed. It consisted of four uniaxial seismic accelerometers and one rate gyroscope per body segment. Tests were done with 10 young healthy volunteers, walking at five different speeds on a treadmill. In order to study the system's accuracy, measurements were made with an optic, passive-marker system and the body-mounted system, simultaneously. In all the comparison cases, the curves obtained from the two systems were very close, showing root mean square errors representing <7\% full range in 75\% of the cases (overall mean 6.64\%, standard deviation 4.13\%) and high coefficients of multiple correlation in 100\% of cases (overall mean 0.9812, standard deviation 0.02). Calibration of the body-mounted system is done against gravity. The body-mounted sensors do not hinder natural movement. The calculation algorithms are computationally demanding and only are applicable off-line. The body-mounted sensors are accurate, inexpensive and portable and allow long-term recordings in clinical, sport and ergonomics settings.},

  abstract  = {This article presents a stimulation control method using a uniaxial gyroscope measuring angular velocity of the shank in the sagittal plane, to control functional electrical stimulation of the triceps surae to improve push-off of stroke subjects during gait. The algorithm is triggered during each swing phase of gait when the angular velocity of the shank is relatively high. Subsequently, the start of the stance phase is detected by a change of sign of the gyroscope signal at approximately the same time as heel strike. Stimulation is triggered when the shank angle reaches a preset value since the beginning of stance. The change of angle is determined by integrating angular velocity from the moment of change of sign. The results show that the real-time reliability of stimulation control was at least 95\% for four of the five stroke subjects tested, two of which were 100\% reliable. For the remaining subject, the reliability was increased from 50\% found during the experiment, to 99\% during offline processing. Our conclusion is that a uniaxial gyroscope on the shank is a simple, more reliable alternative to the heel switch for the purpose of restoring push-off of stroke subjects during gait.},

This makes it difficult for stroke patients use it effectively due to difficulty of torque setting that is suitable for the user movement. Electromyography (EMG) signal measures the electrical signal of muscle contraction. The EMG-based robotics assistive technology would enable the stroke patients to control the robot movement according to the user's own strength of natural movement. This paper discusses the mapping of surface electromyography signals (sEMG) to torque for robotic rehabilitation. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) has been applied as a control algorithm for a number of selected mathematical models. sEMG signals were determined as input data to the mathematical model where parameters of the mathematical model were optimized using PSO. Hence, the good correlated estimated torque as output was obtained.},

Class-I1 systems are underactuated systems with unactuated shape variables, decoupled inputs, and integrable normalized momentums (all to be defined). We show that all Class-I1 underactuated systems can be transformed into cascade systems in nontriangular quadratic form using an explicit change of coordinates and control. In addition, we characterize a subclass of Class-I1 systems, called Class-I11 systems, that can be explicitly transformed into cascade systems in strict feedforward form. This allows application of existing nonlinear control design methods like nested saturations and feedforwarding to control of underactuated systems},

  abstract  = {EMG-driven models can be used to estimate muscle force in biomechanical systems. Collected and processed EMG readings are used as the input of a dynamic system, which is integrated numerically. This approach requires the definition of a reasonably large set of parameters. Some of these vary widely among subjects, and slight inaccuracies in such parameters can lead to large model output errors. One of these parameters is the maximum voluntary contraction force (Fom). This paper proposes an approach to find Fom by estimating muscle physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) using ultrasound (US), which is multiplied by a realistic value of maximum muscle specific tension. Ultrasound is used to measure muscle thickness, which allows for the determination of muscle volume through regression equations. Soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis PCSAs are estimated using published volume proportions among leg muscles, which also requires measurements of muscle fiber length and pennation angle by US. Fom obtained by this approach and from data widely cited in the literature was used to comparatively test a Hill-type EMG-driven model of the ankle joint. The model uses 3 EMGs (Soleus, gastrocnemius medialis and gastrocnemius lateralis) as inputs with joint torque as the output. The EMG signals were obtained in a series of experiments carried out with 8 adult male subjects, who performed an isometric contraction protocol consisting of 10s step contractions at 20{\%} and 60{\%} of the maximum voluntary contraction level. Isometric torque was simultaneously collected using a dynamometer. A statistically significant reduction in the root mean square error was observed when US-obtained Fom was used, as compared to Fom from the literature.},

  abstract   = {A new highly reliable gait phase detection system, which can be used in gait analysis applications and to control the gait cycle of a neuroprosthesis for walking, is described. The system was designed to detect in real-time the following gait phases: stance, heel-off, swing, and heel-strike. The gait phase detection system employed a gyroscope to measure the angular velocity of the foot and three force sensitive resistors to assess the forces exerted by the foot on the shoe sole during walking. A rule-based detection algorithm, which was running on a portable microprocessor board, processed the sensor signals. In the presented experimental study ten able body subjects and six subjects with impaired gait tested the device in both indoor and outdoor environments (0-25 degrees C). The subjects were asked to walk on flat and irregular surfaces, to step over small obstacles, to walk on inclined surfaces, and to ascend and descend stairs. Despite the significant variation in the individual walking styles the system achieved an overall detection reliability above 99\% for both subject groups for the tasks involving walking on flat, irregular, and inclined surfaces. In the case of stair climbing and descending tasks the success rate of the system was above 99\% for the able body subjects and above 96 \% for the subjects with impaired gait. The experiments also showed that the gait phase detection system, unlike other similar devices, was insensitive to perturbations caused by nonwalking activities such as weight shifting between legs during standing, feet sliding, sitting down, and standing up.},

Periodically varying magnetic fields are used to impose magnetic torques, which induce stick–slip motion in the micro-robot. These magnetic forces and torques are incorporated into a comprehensive dynamic model, which captures the behavior of the micro-robot. By pivoting the micro-robot about an edge, non-planar obstacles with characteristic sizes comparable to the robot length can be surmounted. Actuation is demonstrated on several substrates with different surface properties, in a fluid environment, and in a vacuum. Observed micro-robot translation speeds can exceed 10 mm s 21 .},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Direct electrical activation of skeletal muscles of patients with upper motor neuron lesions can restore functional movements, such as standing or walking. Because responses to electrical stimulation are highly nonlinear and time varying, accurate control of muscles to produce functional movements is very difficult. Accurate and predictive mathematical models can facilitate the design of stimulation patterns and control strategies that will produce the desired force and motion. In the present study, we build upon our previous isometric model to capture the effects of constant angular velocity on the forces produced during electrically elicited concentric contractions of healthy human quadriceps femoris muscle. Modelling the isovelocity condition is important because it will enable us to understand how our model behaves under the relatively simple condition of constant velocity and will enable us to better understand the interactions of muscle length, limb velocity, and stimulation pattern on the force produced by the muscle. METHODS: An additional term was introduced into our previous isometric model to predict the force responses during constant velocity limb motion. Ten healthy subjects were recruited for the study. Using a KinCom dynamometer, isometric and isovelocity force data were collected from the human quadriceps femoris muscle in response to a wide range of stimulation frequencies and patterns. {\%} error, linear regression trend lines, and paired t-tests were used to test how well the model predicted the experimental forces. In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed using Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test to obtain a measure of the sensitivity of our model's output to changes in model parameters. RESULTS: Percentage RMS errors between modelled and experimental forces determined for each subject at each stimulation pattern and velocity showed that the errors were in general less than 20{\%}. The coefficients of determination between the measured and predicted forces show that the model accounted for approximately 86{\%} and approximately 85{\%} of the variances in the measured force-time integrals and peak forces, respectively. CONCLUSION: The range of predictive abilities of the isovelocity model in response to changes in muscle length, velocity, and stimulation frequency for each individual make it ideal for dynamic applications like FES cycling.},

An accurate and predictive mathematical model can facilitate the design of stimulation patterns that produce the desired force. The present study is a first step in developing a mathematical model for non-isometric muscle contractions. The goals of this study were to: (1) identify how our isometric force model's parameters vary with changes in knee joint angle, (2) identify the best knee flexion angle to parameterize this model, and (3) validate the model by comparing experimental data to predictions in response to a wide range of stimulation frequencies and muscle lengths. Results showed that by parabolically varying one of the free parameters with knee joint angle and fixing the other parameters at the values identified at 40 degrees of knee flexion, the model could predict the force responses to a wide range of stimulation frequencies and patterns at different muscle lengths. This work showed that the current isometric force model is capable of predicting the changes in skeletal muscle force at different muscle lengths.},

  abstract   = {Superimposition of electrical stimulation during voluntary contractions is used to produce functional movements in individuals with central nervous system impairment, to evaluate the ability to activate a muscle, to characterize the nature of fatigue, and to improve muscle strength during postsurgical rehabilitation. Currently, the manner in which voluntary contractions and electrically elicited forces summate is not well understood. The objective of the present study is to develop a model that predicts the forces obtained when electrical stimulation is superimposed on a volitional contraction. Quadriceps femoris muscles of 12 able-bodied subjects were tested. Our results showed that the total force produced when electrical stimulation was superimposed during a volitional contraction could be modeled by the equation T=V+S[(MaxForce-V)/MaxForce]N, where T is the total force produced, V is the force in response to volitional contraction alone, S is the force response to the electrical stimulation alone, MaxForce is the maximum force-generating ability of the muscle, and N is a parameter that we posit depends on the differences in the motor unit recruitment order and firing rates between volitional and electrically elicited contractions. In addition, our results showed that the model predicted accurately (intraclass correlation coefficient{\textgreater}or=0.97) the total force in response to a wide range of stimulation intensities and frequencies superimposed on a wide range of volitional contraction levels. Thus the model will be helpful to clinicians and scientists to predict the amount of stimulation needed to produce the targeted force levels in individuals with partial paralysis.},

  abstract = {—A robot-assisted system for medical diagnostic ultrasound has been developed by the authors. This paper presents the visual servo controller used in this system. While the ultrasound transducer is positioned by a robot, the operator, the robot controller, and an ultrasound image processor have shared control over its motion. Ultrasound image features that can be selected by the operator are recognized and tracked by a variety of techniques. Based on feature tracking, ultrasound image servoing in three axes has been incorporated in the interface and can be enabled to automatically compensate, through robot motions, unwanted motions in the plane of the ultrasound beam. The accuracy of the system is illustrated through a 3-D reconstruction of an ultrasound phantom. An Internet-based robot-assisted teleultrasound system has also been demonstrated.},

  abstract  = {This paper addresses stability analysis and controller synthesis for linear multi-rate sampled-data systems. In these systems, a plant with linear dynamics is controlled by a linear controller which is located in the feedback loop between a sensing block and a zero-order-hold. The sensing block comprises several sensors with asynchronous uncertain non-uniform sampling intervals. We present sufficient Krasovskii-based stability and stabilization criteria as a set of linear matrix inequalities. It is shown through examples that choosing the right sensors with adequate sampling frequencies has a considerable impact on controller design and stability of the closed-loop system.},

In defining the class of systems, a few simplifying assumptions are made on the structure of the dynamics; in particular, the damping forces are assumed to be linear in velocities. We first propose a switching surface design for this class of systems, and subsequently, a switched algorithm to reach this surface in finite time using conventional and higher order sliding mode controllers. The stability of the closed-loop system is investigated with an undefined relative degree of the sliding functions. The controller gains are designed such that the controller stabilizes the actual system with parametric uncertainty. The proposed control algorithm is applied to two benchmark problems: a mobile robot and an underactuated underwater vehicle. Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed scheme.},

Sufficient conditions are presented to ensure global exponential stability of the observation errors by constructing a Lyapunov–Krasovskii function. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

The right biceps brachii muscles of seven normal young adult subjects were tested. We observed that exponential functions could well represent the relationships between the normalized EMG root-mean-square (RMS) and the torque, the RMS and the muscle deformation SMG, and the RMS and the pennation angle SMG for the data of the contraction phase, with exponent coefficients of 0.0341 +/- 0.0148 (Mean SD), 0.0619 +/- 0.0273, and 0.0266 +/- 0.0076, respectively. In addition, the preliminary results also demonstrated linear relationships between the normalized torque and the muscle deformation as well as the pennation angle with the ratios of 9 .79 +/- 3.01 and 2.02 +/- 0.53, respectively. The overall mean R2 for the regressions was approximately 0.9 and the overall mean relative root mean square error (RRMSE) smaller than 15{\%}. The potential values of SMG together with EMG to provide a more comprehensive assessment for the muscle functions should be further investigated with more subjects and more muscle groups.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND: Stimulators applying functional electrical stimulation (FES) to the common peroneal nerve improve walking with a foot drop, which occurs in several disorders. OBJECTIVE: To compare the orthotic and therapeutic effects of a foot drop stimulator on walking performance of subjects with chronic nonprogressive (eg, stroke) and progressive (eg, multiple sclerosis) disorders. METHODS: Subjects with nonprogressive (41) and progressive (32) conditions used a foot drop stimulator for 3 to 12 months while walking in the community. Walking speed was measured with a 10-m test and a 4-minute figure-8 test; physiological cost index (PCI) and device usage were also measured. The subjects were tested with FES on and off (orthotic effect) before and after (therapeutic effect) stimulator use. RESULTS: After 3 months of FES use, the nonprogressive and progressive groups had a similar, significant orthotic effect (5.0\% and 5.7\%, respectively, P < .003; percentage change in mean values) and therapeutic effect with FES off (17.8\% and 9.1\%, respectively, P < .005) on figure-8 walking speed. Overall, PCI showed a decreasing trend (P = .031). The therapeutic effect on figure-8 speed diverged later between both groups to 28.0\% (P < .001) and 7.9\% at 11 months. The combined therapeutic plus orthotic effect on figure-8 speed at 11 months was, respectively, 37.8\% (P < .001) and 13.1\% (P = .012); PCI decreased 18.2\% (P = .038) and 6.5\%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with progressive and nonprogressive disorders had an orthotic benefit from FES up to 11 months. The therapeutic effect increased for 11 months in nonprogressive disorders but only for 3 months in progressive disorders. The combined effect remained significant and clinically relevant.},

  abstract  = {Gait initiation in transfemoral amputees (TFA) is different from non-amputees. This is mainly caused by the lack of stability and push-off from the prosthetic leg. Adding control and artificial push-off to the prosthesis may therefore be beneficial to TFA. In this study the feasibility of real-time intention detection of gait initiation was determined by mimicking the TFA situation in non-amputees. EMG and inertial sensor data was measured in 10 non-amputees. Only data available in TFA was used to determine if gait initiation can be predicted in time to control a transfemoral prosthesis to generate push-off and stability. Toe-off and heel-strike of the leading limb are important parameters to be detected, to control a prosthesis and to time push-off. The results show that toe-off and heel-strike of the leading limb can be detected using EMG and kinematic data in non-amputees 130–260ms in advance. This leaves enough time to control a prosthesis. Based on these results we hypothesize that similar results can be found in TFA, allowing for adequate control of a prosthesis during gait initiation.},

  abstract  = {In this study we determined if detection of the onset of gait initiation in transfemoral amputees can be useful for voluntary control of upper leg prostheses. From six transfemoral amputees inertial sensor data and EMG were measured at the prosthetic leg during gait initiation. First, initial movement was detected from the inertial sensor data. Subsequently it was determined whether EMG could predict initial movement before detection based on the inertial sensors with comparable consistency as the inertial sensors. From the inertial sensors the initial movement can be determined. If the prosthetic leg leads, the upper leg accelerometer data was able to detect initial movement best. If the intact leg leads the upper leg gyroscope data performed best. Inertial sensors at the upper leg in general showed detections at the same time or earlier than those at the lower leg. EMG can predict initial movement up to a 138ms in advance, when the prosthetic leg leads. One subject showed consistent EMG onset up to 248ms before initial movement in the intact leg leading condition. A new method to detect initial movement from inertial sensors was presented and can be useful for additional prosthetic control. EMG measured at the prosthetic leg can be used for prediction of gait initiation when the prosthetic leg is leading, but for the intact leg leading condition this will not be of additional value.},

  abstract = {A Lyapunov direct method is proposed for a class of underactuated, mechanical systems. The direct method is derived in general for systems having n degrees of freedom of which only m {\&}lt; n are actuated. The applications consist of a class of systems where the elements of the mass/inertia matrix and the gravitational forces/torques are either constants or functions of a single generalized position variable and where n is two and m is one. The time derivative of the candidate Lyapunov function produces a relation that is solved via a matching method. Some of the matching equations consist of linear differential and partial differential equations. It is shown for this class of systems, that the solutions of these linear differential and partial differential equations necessary for assuring asymptotic stability can be evaluated numerically as part of the feedback process. Examples are presented involving an inverted pendulum cart and an inertia wheel pendulum},

Proposed areas of application for these microrobots include sensing, diagnosis, and surgical procedures in intraocular, cardiovascular, and inner-ear environments. A prototype microrobot and steering system are introduced. Fluid drag experiments performed on the prototype robot show that the 950 x 400 {\{}micro{\}} m elliptical shape has a spherical equivalent diameter of 477 {\{}micro{\}} m. Drag forces combined with saturation magnetization (5 x 10 5 A/m) of the prototype indicate that the required magnetic field gradients for application inside the vitreous humor and blood vessels are on the order of 0.7T/m.},

  abstract = {The goal of this article is to review the state-of-the-art tracking methods, classify them into different categories, and identify new trends. Object tracking, in general, is a challenging problem. Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion, changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene, nonrigid object structures, object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions, and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically, assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application. In this survey, we categorize the tracking methods on the basis of the object and motion representations used, provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category, and examine their pros and cons. Moreover, we discuss the important issues related to tracking including the use of appropriate image features, selection of motion models, and detection of objects.},

The helical swimmer consists of a helical tail resembling the dimensions of a natural flagellum and a thin soft-magnetic head on one end. The swimming locomotion of ABF is precisely controlled by three orthogonal electromagnetic coil pairs. Microsphere manipulation is performed, and the thrust force generated by an ABF is analyzed. ABF swimmers represent the first demonstration of microscopic artificial swimmers that use helical propulsion.

  abstract  = {Ultrasound imaging has been used frequently for the study of muscle contraction, including measurements of pennation angles and fascicle orientations. However, these measurements were traditionally conducted by manually drawing lines on the ultrasound images. In this study, we proposed a modified Hough transform (HT), aiming at automatically estimating orientations of straight line-shaped patterns, such as muscle fibers and muscle-bone interface in ultrasound images. The new method first located the global maximum in the HT accumulator matrix, which corresponded to the most dominant collinear feature points globally, using the standard HT; then the pixels close to the detected line were removed from the edge map, the HT accumulator matrix was calculated again, i.e., revoting, and a new line was detected. The iteration was repeated until the predefined termination conditions were satisfied. The performance of the algorithm was tested using computer-generated images with different levels of noises, as well as clinical ultrasound images, and compared with that of the conventional method. It was found that the orientation estimation results obtained by the new algorithm were well correlated (R2= 0.965), with those obtained using the traditional method, i.e., drawing lines manually and reading the angles with the assistance of software. Further mean-difference plots revealed a difference of 0.18 ± 2.41° between the two methods at the 95{\%} confidence level. Compared with the traditional method, the new algorithm was more capable of handling with highly noisy data and could avoid the aliasing problem, i.e., reporting multiple lines instead of single expected line. The results of this study suggested that the proposed revoting HT can be potentially used for the reliable and nonsubjective automatic estimation of the orientations of muscle fibers in musculoskeletal ultrasound images.

Since then this technology has focused on developing systems for assisting and augmenting human power. Later this technology is expanded into other applications such as limb rehabilitation and tele-operations. Exoskeleton research is still a growing area and demands multi-disciplinary approaches in solving complex technical issues. In this paper, the developments of active upper-limb exoskeleton robots are reviewed. This paper presents the major developments occurred in the history, the key milestones during the evolution and major research challenges in the present day context of hardware systems of upper-limb exoskeleton robots. Moreover, the paper provides a classification, a comparison and a design overview of mechanisms, actuation and power transmission of most of the upper-limb exoskeleton robots that have been found in the literature. A brief review on the control methods of upper-limb exoskeleton robots is also presented. At the end, a discussion on the future directions of the upper-limb exoskeleton robots was included.},

Considering our application, an impedance controlled gait rehabilitation robot for treadmill-training, we designed an actuation system that might avoid these drawbacks. It combines a lightweight joint and a simple structure with adequate torque source quality. It consists of a servomotor, a flexible Bowden cable transmission, and a force feedback loop based on a series elastic element. A basic model was developed that is shown to describe the basic dynamics of the actuator well enough for design purpose.Further measurements show that performance is sufficient for use in a gait rehabilitation robot. The demanded force tracking bandwidths were met: 11 Hz bandwidth for the full force range (demanded 4 Hz) and 20 Hz bandwidth for smaller force range (demanded 12 Hz). The mechanical output i...},

The main purpose of this paper is to establish easily verifiable conditions under which the delayed stochastic neural network is exponentially stable in the mean square in the presence of both the discrete and distributed delays. By employing a new Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional and conducting stochastic analysis, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to derive the criteria of the exponential stability. Furthermore, the main results are specialized to deal with the analysis problem for the global asymptotic stability within the same LMI framework. The proposed criteria can be readily checked by using some standard numerical packages such as the Matlab LMI toolbox. A simple example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed testing criteria.},

We present a one degree of freedom exoskeleton called the RoboKnee which achieves a high level of transparency. User intent is determined through the knee joint angle and ground reaction forces. Torque is applied across the knee in order to allow the user's quadriceps muscles to relax. Low impedance is achieved through the use of series elastic actuators. The RoboKnee allows the wearer to climb stairs and perform deep knee bends while carrying a significant load in a backpack. The device provides most of the energy required to work against gravity while the user stays in control, deciding when and where to walk, as well as providing balance and control.

  abstract  = {We previously reported the development of a force- and fatigue-model system that predicted accurately forces during repetitive fatiguing activation of human skeletal muscles using brief duration (six-pulse) stimulation trains. The model system was tested in the present study using force responses produced by longer duration stimulation trains, containing up to 50 pulses. Our results showed that our model successfully predicted the peak forces produced when the muscle was repetitively activated with stimulation trains of frequencies ranging from 20 to 40 Hz, train durations ranging from 0.5 to 1 s, and varied pulse patterns. The predicted peak forces throughout each protocol matched the experimental peak forces with r2 values above 0.9 and predicted successfully the forces at the end of each protocol with {\textless}15{\%} error for all protocols tested. The success of our model system further supports its potential use for the design of optimal stimulation patterns for individual users during functional electrical stimulation.},

  abstract = {Series elastic actuators have a spring intentionally placed at the actuator output. Measuring the spring strain gives an accurate measurement for closed-loop actuator force control. The low spring stiffness allows for high gain while maintaining actuator stability. This gives series elastic actuators many desirable properties including high bandwidth at moderate force amplitudes, low output impedance, large dynamic range, internal error rejection and tolerance to shock loading. However, as a consequence of the elasticity, the large force bandwidth capabilities of the actuator are reduced when operating at power saturation limits. Series elasticity is examined with three models. First, it is generalized by using a minimal actuator model. This mathematical model consists of an ideal velocity source actuator, linear spring and proportional controller. Series elasticity is then demonstrated in two cases of physical actuator systems. The first is a linear hydraulic piston with a servo valve and the second is an electric motor with a geared linear transmission. Both case studies have a linear spring and low complexity control systems. The case studies are analyzed mathematically and verified with physical hardware. A series elastic actuator under simple closed-loop control is physically equivalent to a second order system. This means that an equivalent mass defined by the control system and physical parameters, is effectively in series with the physical spring connected to the actuator load. Nondimensional analysis of the dynamics clarifies important parametric relationships into a few key dimensionless groups and aids understanding when trying to scale the actuators. The physical equivalent abstractions and non-dimensional dynamic equations help in the development of guidelines for choosing a proper spring stiffness given required force, speed and power requirements for the actuator.},

  abstract = {European Recommendations for Surface ElectroMyoGraphy, results of the SENIAM project, is a publication of the SENIAM project, published by Roessingh Research and Development b.v. ISBN 90-75452-15-2. PREFACE Surface EMG for Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM) is one of the concerted actions funded by the European Commission (BIOMED II-Program). The aim of these concerted actions is to enhance international cooperation in a given field of interest. A mere fact that the EC has decided to fund this concerted action on Surface ElectroMyoGraphy (SEMG), should be regarded as a real acknowledgement of the maturity and potential benefits of SEMG. At the beginning of the SENIAM project we have formulated two main objectives: The first objective was to exchange knowledge and experience on SEMG between different countries and disciplines and to enhance the transfer of knowledge between basic and applied research. This objective has been realised especially by the organisation of four general workshops, each of them covering a wide range of topics, enabling cross fertilisations between the different disciplines and enabling the start of a real European body of knowledge on SEMG. Another activity that has contributed significantly to this objective were the small projects. These were relatively short visits involving at least 2 SENIAM partners in order to combine knowledge and experience to solve particular questions of common interes. These visits have started in many cases a fruitful collaboration and have resulted in many papers in the scientific journals. The second objective of SENIAM was to develop recommendations on key items that presently prevent a useful exchange of knowledge and experience, especially with respect to experimental / clinical data. These key items were considered to be sensors, sensor placement procedures, signal processing and modelling. The general approach was that an inventory was made on the actual use of the topics in the European labs and in parallel a topical workshop was organised to obtain the scientific state of the art. Extensive discussions resulted in a set of preliminary recommendations. These were then sent to the SENIAM partners and members of the SENIAM club to create consensus. Many, over 100, European experts in the field of SEMG have contributed to the results and as such a real European body of knowledge on SEMG has been created. One could state that certainly with respect to this second objective, this booklet contains the summary of the SENIAM project. It indeed contains all the recommendations on these four topics. As such it is expected that acceptance of these recommendations will bring the use of SEMG a major step forwards. This will facilitate to a large extend the exchange of data of e.g. patients with neuromuscular disorders, ergonomic field studies and gait analysis. As such it will contribute to bringing SEMG one step further, as a mature tool to investigate the functioning of the neuromuscular system.},

The intra-class correlation coefficients and standard errors of measurement as a percentage of the mean for CSA, MT and EI ranged from 0.715 to 0.984 and from 3.145 to 12.541{\%} in the males and from 0.724 to 0.977 and from 4.571 to 17.890{\%} in the females, respectively. The males had greater CSAs and MTs and lower EIs than the females (p = 0.002–0.049), and significant relationships were observed between CSA and MT (r = 0.714-0.938, p ? 0.001–0.023).

The orientation of myofibers decides the effects of the stress distribution and the whole heart deformation. It is important to image and quantitatively extract these orientations for understanding the cardiac physiological and pathological mechanism and for diagnosis of chronic diseases. Ultrasound has been wildly used in cardiac diagnosis because of its ability of performing dynamic and noninvasive imaging and because of its low cost. An extraction method is proposed to automatically detect the cardiac myofiber orientations from high frequency ultrasound images. First, heart walls containing myofibers are imaged by B-mode high frequency ({\textless}20 MHz) ultrasound imaging. Second, myofiber orientations are extracted from ultrasound images using the proposed method that combines a nonlinear anisotropic diffusion filter, Canny edge detector, Hough transform, and K-means clustering. This method is validated by the results of ultrasound data from phantoms and pig hearts.},

Sixteen healthy subjects used different signals in a random order to control the cursor on a personal computer screen to cancel the letter “E” in a sequence of vertically arranged letters. Subjects' performance was evaluated under isometric contraction and wrist extension using the extensor carpi radiali muscle. The percentage of successfully cancelled Es using SMG decreased by 21 ± 16{\%} and 17 ± 11{\%} in isometric contraction and wrist extension tests, respectively, compared with the corresponding performances using force and angle signals. The corresponding reduction recorded by using EMG was 40 ± 29{\%} and 41 ± 25{\%}. In addition, there was a significant decrease by using EMG compared with that by SMG (p {\textless} 0.001). The results also demonstrated that there was no significant difference of performances of canceling E between the single and dual tasks by using any of the control signals (p {\textgreater} 0.99). Furthermore, the SMG control provided more consistent performances under the single and dual tasks compared with EMG control.},

Measurements in cats and humans have since revealed that muscle fascicle length changes can be uncoupled from those of the muscle-tendon unit. Ultrasonography is frequently used to estimate fascicle length changes during human locomotion. Fascicle length analysis requires time consuming manual methods that are prone to human error and experimenter bias. To bypass these limitations, we have developed an automatic fascicle tracking method based on the Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm with an affine optic flow extension. The aims of this study were to compare gastrocnemius fascicle length changes during locomotion using the automated and manual approaches and to determine the repeatability of the automated approach. Ultrasound was used to examine gastrocnemius fascicle lengths in eight participants walking at 4, 5, 6, and 7 km/h and ...},

The muscle architectural parameters extracted from ultrasound imaging, which reflect muscle contractions, were defined as sonomyography (SMG) in this study. The cross-sectional area (CSA) and aspect ratio between muscle width and thickness (width/thickness) were extracted from ultrasound images. The results showed that the CSA of RF muscles decreased by 7.25±4.07{\%} when muscle torque output changed from 0{\%} to 90{\%} MVC, and the aspect ratio decreased by 41.66±7.96{\%}. The muscle contraction level and SMG data were strongly correlated (R2=0.961, P=0.003, for CSA and R2=0.999, P{\textless}0.001, for width/thickness ratio). The data indicated a significant difference (P{\textless}0.05) in percentage changes for CSA and aspect ratio among step, ramp increasing, and decreasing contractions. The normalized EMG RMS in ramp increasing was 8.25±4.00{\%} higher than step (P=0.002). The normalized MMG RMS of step contraction was significantly lower than ramp increasing and decreasing, with averaged differences of 12.22±3.37{\%} (P=0.001) and 12.06±3.37{\%} (P=0.001), respectively. The results of this study demonstrated that the CSA and aspect ratio, i.e., SMG signals, can provide useful information about muscle contractions. They may therefore complement EMG and MMG for studying muscle activation strategies under different conditions.},

  abstract  = {Ultrasound and electromyography (EMG) are two of the most commonly used diagnostic tools for the assessment of muscles. Recently, many studies reported the simultaneous collection of EMG signals and ultrasound images, which were normally amplified and digitized by different devices. However, there is lack of a systematic method to synchronize them and no study has reported the effects of ultrasound gel to the EMG signal collection during the simultaneous data collection. In this paper, we introduced a new method to synchronize ultrasound B-scan images, EMG signals, joint angles and other related signals (e.g. force and velocity signals) in real-time. The B-mode ultrasound images were simultaneously captured by the PC together with the surface EMG (SEMG) and the joint angle signal. The deformations of the forearm muscles induced by wrist motions were extracted from a sequence of ultrasound images, named as Sonomyography (SMG). Preliminary experiments demonstrated that the proposed method could reliably collect the synchronized ultrasound images, SEMG signals and joint angle signals in real-time. In addition, the effect of ultrasound gel on the SEMG signals when the EMG electrodes were close to the ultrasound probe was studied. It was found that the SEMG signals were not significantly affected by the amount of the ultrasound gel. The system is being used for the study of contractions of various muscles as well as the muscle fatigue.},

OBJECTIVE
To determine (1) the frequency, severity, and reported course of 7 symptoms in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) and (2) the association between these symptoms and patient functioning. 

DESIGN
Postal survey. 

SETTING
Community. 

INTERVENTION
A survey that included measures of the frequency, severity, and recalled course of pain, fatigue, numbness, weakness, shortness of breath, vision loss, and memory loss, as well as a measure of community integration and psychologic functioning was mailed to a sample of persons with SCI. One hundred forty-seven usable surveys were returned (response rate, 43{\%} of surveys mailed). 

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
The frequency and average severity of each symptom was computed, and the frequencies of each type of reported course were noted. Analyses estimated the associations among the symptoms, and between symptom severity and measures of patient functioning. 

RESULTS
The most common symptoms were pain, weakness, fatigue, and numbness. All symptoms were reported to remain the same or to get worse more often than they were reported to improve once they began. Pain, weakness, fatigue, and memory loss were the symptoms most closely associated with patient functioning. 

CONCLUSIONS
Patients with SCI must deal with a number of secondary complications in addition to any disability caused by the injury itself. Of 7 symptoms studied, pain, weakness, and fatigue appeared to be most common and most closely linked to patient social and mental health functioning. Research is needed to identify the causal relationships between perceived symptoms and quality of life in patients with SCI and to identify effective treatments for those symptoms shown to impact patient functioning.},

  abstract  = {Electromyography (EMG) has been widely used for the assessment of musculoskeletal functions and the control of electrical prostheses, which make use of the EMG signal generated by the contraction of the residual muscles. In spite of the successful applications of EMG in different fields, it has some inherent limitations, such as the difficulty to differentiate the actions of neighboring muscles and to collect signals from deep muscles using the surface EMG. The majority of current EMG controlled prostheses can only provide sequential on–off controls using signals from two groups of muscles, so the users are required to put many conscious efforts in monitoring the speed and range of motion of the terminal devices being controlled. Recently, many alternative signals based on the detection of dimensional changes of muscles or tendons during actions have been reported. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of the dimensional change of muscles detected using sonography for musculoskeletal assessment and control. A portable B-mode ultrasound scanner was used to collect the dynamic ultrasound images of the forearm muscles of six normally limbed young adults and three amputee subjects. A motion analysis system was used to collect the movement of the wrist angle during the experiments for the normal subjects. It was demonstrated that the morphological changes of forearm muscles during actions can be successfully detected by ultrasound and linearly correlated (R2=0.876±0.042, mean±S.D.) with the wrist angle. We named these sonographically detected signals about the architectural change of the muscle as sonomyography (SMG). The mean ratio between the wrist angle and the percentage deformation of the forearm muscle was 7.2±3.7°/{\%} for the normal subjects. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of this ratio among the three repeated tests was 0.868. The SMG signals from the residual forearms were also successfully detected when the three amputee subjects contracted their residual muscles. The results demonstrated that SMG had potentials for the musculoskeletal control and assessment.},

An m-dimensional formulation of this method is analysed with respect to its well-posedness and scale-space properties. An efficient scheme is presented which uses a stabilization by a semi-implicit additive operator splitting (AOS), and the scale-space behaviour of this method is illustrated by applying it to both 2-D and 3-D images.},

Similarly, as the knee was extended, the angle of pennation (fascicle angle, defined as the angle between fascicles and aponeurosis) increased (relaxed, from 14 to 18°; tensed, from 14 to 21°), and a greater increase in the pennation angle was observed in the tensed than in the relaxed condition wh...},

Neuromuscular biofeedback methods include electromyography (EMG) biofeedback and real-time ultrasound imaging (RTUS) biofeedback. EMG biofeedback is the most widely investigated method of biofeedback and appears to be effective in the treatment of many musculoskeletal conditions and in post cardiovascular accident (CVA) rehabilitation. RTUS biofeedback has been demonstrated effective in the treatment of low back pain (LBP) and pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. Cardiovascular biofeedback methods have been shown to be effective in the treatment of a number of health conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, asthma, fibromyalgia and even psychological disorders however a systematic review in this field has yet to be conducted. Similarly, the number of large scale studies examining the use of respiratory biofeedback in rehabilitation is limited. Measurements of movement, postural control and force output can be made using a number of different devices and used to deliver biomechanical biofeedback. Inertial based sensing biofeedback is the most widely researched biomechanical biofeedback method, with a number of studies showing it to be effective in improving measures of balance in a number of populations. Other types of biomechanical biofeedback include force plate systems, electrogoniometry, pressure biofeedback and camera based systems however the evidence for these is limited. Biofeedback is generally delivered using visual displays, acoustic or haptic signals, however more recently virtual reality (VR) or exergaming technology have been used as biofeedback signals. VR and exergaming technology have been primarily investigated in post-CVA rehabilitation, however, more recent work has shown this type of biofeedback to be effective in improving exercise technique in musculoskeletal populations. While a number of studies in this area have been conducted, further large scale studies and reviews investigating different biofeedback applications in different clinical populations are required.},

  abstract  = {There is a growing trend in the physical therapy profession to use conventional grayscale brightness (B-mode) ultrasound imaging (USI) as a tool to assess the morphological (form and structure) and morphometric (measures of form) characteristics of muscle, and to use these findings to draw conclusions regarding muscle function. This trend is reflected in numerous published investigations. As many physical therapists may lack training in the principles and instrumentation underlying USI use, it is critical that therapists gain a clear understanding of the information that USI can, and cannot, provide about muscle function before employing the technique for either research or clinical applications. Failure to do so may result in the propagation of inaccurate terminology and beliefs. This paper aims to clarify the role that USI has in the assessment of muscle function, first, by briefly reviewing how conventional grayscale B-mode ultrasound images and clips are generated, and second, by summarizing the types of information that these images can provide. It also discusses the various factors that need to be considered when interpreting a dynamic USI assessment of muscle specifically as it relates to the assessment of muscle function.},

  abstract  = {Background: Ultrasound imaging is a valuable tool which, when applied appropriately, has the potential to provide information regarding the mechanics of abdominal muscle contraction. Typically, changes in muscle thickness are obtained and interpreted. However, the link between ultrasound measures of muscle thickening and EMG measures of activation is not clear. Methods: Five healthy males performed a series of abdominal muscle contractions while surface EMG and trunk posture were monitored and ultrasound images of the internal oblique and external oblique were captured both at relaxation and upon contraction. Ramped isometric flexor and extensor moment contractions were also assessed and compared between EMG and ultrasound. Findings: No definitive relationship between increases in muscle activation and corresponding measures of thickening was observed. Correlations between the two measures, across all contraction types, were 0.14 for internal oblique and -0.22 for external oblique. Interpretation: The lack of clear association between abdominal muscle activation and thickening may be due to the composite laminate-like structure of the abdominal wall, with force being transmitted between obliquely oriented muscle layers. Thus, ultrasound alone may not be a valid measure of muscle activation or force in the unique architecture of the abdominal wall. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract  = {The in vivo assessment of the biomechanical properties of the skeletal muscle is a complex issue because the muscle is an anisotropic, viscoelastic and dynamic medium. In this article, these mechanical properties are characterized for the brachialis muscle in vivo using a noninvasive ultrasound-based technique. This supersonic shear imaging technique combines an ultra-fast ultrasonic system and the remote generation of transient mechanical forces into tissue via the radiation force of focused ultrasonic beams. Such an ultrasonic radiation force is induced deep within the muscle by a conventional ultrasonic probe and the resulting shear waves are then imaged with the same probe (5 MHz) at an ultra-fast framerate (up to 5000 frames/s). Local tissue velocity maps are obtained with a conventional speckle tracking technique and provide a full movie of the shear wave propagation through the entire muscle. Shear wave group velocities are then estimated using a time of flight algorithm. This approach provides a complete set of quantitative and in vivo parameters describing the muscle's mechanical properties as a function of active voluntary contraction as well as passive extension of healthy volunteers. Anisotropic properties are also estimated by tilting the probe head with respects to the main muscular fibers direction. Finally, the dispersion of the shear waves is studied for these different configurations and shear modulus and shear viscosity are quantitatively assessed assuming the viscoelastic Voigt's model. {\textcopyright} 2010 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine {\&} Biology.},

  abstract = {The force of a single muscle is not directly measurable without invasive methods. Yet invasive techniques are not appropriate for clinical use, thus a non-invasive technique that combined the electromyographic (EMG) signal and a neuromuscular model was developed to determine in vivo active muscle forces at the hip. The EMG-to-force processing (EFP) model included active and passive moment components, and the net EFP moment was compared with the hip moment obtained with standard inverse dynamics techniques ({\{}''{\}}gold standard{\{}''{\}}). The two methods were compared at percent gait cycle intervals, and the correlation coefficient between methods was excellent (r(2) = 91). The closeness of fit confirms that the approach is a reasonable approximation of net moment and, possibly, individual muscle forces. The greatest estimated hip force was produced by a hip abductor. A novel finding was that the hip adductors did not behave a single synergistic group. The Adductor Magnus synergistically assisted other hip extensors, and produced forces that were out-of-phase with the other hip adductor forces. Rectus Femoris was only active during hip flexion (not knee extension).},

  abstract  = {Gait dysfunction due to lower limb central paralysis, frequently involving drop foot, is a common cause of disability in multiple sclerosis and has been treated with transcutaneous functional electrical stimulation (FES). We provide here the first report of 4-channel semi-implantable FES of the peroneal nerve which has been successfully used for rehabilitation in patients following stroke. FES was implemented via a 4-channel semi-implantable closed-loop system (ActiGait{\textregistered}, {\textcopyright}Ottobock), generating dorsiflexion in drop foot. Walking distance, gait symmetry (temporospatial gait analyses, Vicon Motion Systems{\textregistered}), gait velocity (10 m walking test) and quality of life (SF-36 questionnaire) were measured to evaluate the therapeutic benefit of this system in two patients with progressive MS. Walking distance increased from 517 to 1884 m in Patient 1 and from 52 to 506 m in Patient 2. Gait velocity did not change significantly in Patient 1 and increased from 0.6 to 0.8 m/s in Patient 2. Maximum deviations of center of mass from the midline to each side changed significantly after 3 months of stimulation compared to baseline, decreasing from 15 to 12 mm in Patient 1 and from 47 to 37 mm in Patient 2. Both patients experienced reduced pain and fatigue and benefits to quality of life. Adverse events did not occur during the observation period. We conclude that implantable 4-channel FES systems are not only feasible but present a promising new alternative for treating central drop foot in MS patients.},

Muscle activity was elicited in 11 normal subjects by performing six manual muscle tests. Three of the tests followed the standard technique and three were modifications designed to provide better differentiation of muscle action. All electromyographic data were quantified by computer integration and normalized to cancel out sampling inconsistency. None of the muscle tests totally restricted activity to the designated muscle, but the tests did determine which was the strongest participant. During the standard specific gastrocnemius and soleus muscle tests, the corresponding surface electrode provided a lower electromyogram than did the matching wire electrode; that is, the surface-to-wire-electrode ratio was less than one (gastrocnemius = 0.74, soleus = 0.58). This ratio was greater than one when the electromyogram was being recorded from one muscle while testing another muscle (gastrocnemius = 1.55, soleus = 1.92). The mathematical model relating surface-electrode values to the wire-electrode data from all three muscles identified 60 percent of the surface gastrocnemius electrode electromyogram as arising from that muscle, while only 36 percent of the soleus surface electrode data related to the activity of the soleus: Sg = .19Ws + 60Wg + .13Wt + .08Wo and Ss = .36Ws + .31Wg + .22Wt + .11Wo.},

Results indicated that both mean power frequency (MPF) and amplitude (rmsEMG) of the surface EMG fell significantly (P less than 0.001) together with a progressive reduction in MU spike amplitude and firing frequency during sustained MVC. During 50{\%} MVC there was a significant decline in MPF (P less than 0.001), but this decline was accompanied by a significant increase in rmsEMG (P less than 0.001) and a progressive MU recruitment as evidenced by an increased number of MUs with relatively large spike amplitude.

As a result of recent technological advances it is reasonable to assume that there will soon be implantable myoelectric sensors which will enable the internal MES to be used as input to these controllers. An internal MES measurement should have less muscular crosstalk allowing for more independent control sites. However, it remains unclear if this benefit outweighs the loss of the more global information contained in the surface MES. This paper compares the classification accuracy of six pattern recognition-based myoelectric controllers which use multi-channel surface MES as inputs to the same controllers which use multi-channel intramuscular MES as inputs. An experiment was designed during which surface and intramuscular MES were collected simultaneously for 10 different classes of isometric contraction. There was no significant difference in classification accuracy as a result of using the intramuscular MES measurement technique when compared to the surface MES measurement technique. Impressive classification accuracy (97{\%}) could be achieved by optimally selecting only three channels of surface MES.},

The general shape for the curvilinear portion of the curve was based on phenomenological data reported by Woods and Bigland-Ritchie. The one-parameter A-model is easy to implement, and when used with an EMG-driven Hill-type model, was shown to provide a better fit of the measured joint moment. Optimization methods were used to determine the appropriate curvature of the relationship for each muscle, and thus introduced a degree of “tuning” to each subject.},

  abstract  = {Rupture of the distal tendons of the biceps brachii and the brachialis often consists of a clean avulsion of the end of the tendons from their tuberosities. In most of the reattachment procedures these tendons are reinserted to the same tuberosities. The purpose of this study was to examine the kinetic activity in the upper limb when the insertion locations of the two prime elbow flexors are altered. The right upper limb was modeled as a two-bar linkage moving in the vertical plane of the scapula. Our Hill-type musculotendon actuation system was modeled in terms of five muscles moving in three-dimensional space. The prime elbow flexors, i.e. the biceps brachii and the brachialis, were excited maximally, while the other muscles were left passive and were included as such in the analysis. The limb kinetics was studied in four different insertion locations of the biceps brachii and the brachialis. Data on the elbow kinematics, the muscle tension histories, the muscle length-tension and velocity-tension relationships and the joint constraint forces were produced. The results indicate that when the new insertions of the biceps brachii and the brachialis are located further away from the elbow joint axis, the moments of these muscles about the joint axis increase. However, the shortening velocities of these muscles are increased as well, which results in a reduced tension. In addition, the magnitudes of the compressive force, the tangential forces and the torsional and bending moments are reduced. These results suggest that, whenever surgically possible, reinsertion of ruptured distal tendons of the biceps brachii and the brachialis more distally to the location of their tuberosities should be beneficial. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

  year      = {1992},
  abstract  = {Electrical stimulation-induced leg cycle ergometry has been shown to provide a variety of therapeutic benefits for spinal cord injured paraplegics and quadriplegics. The stimulation, however, is generally inefficient both mechanically and metabolically. As a result, the stimulated muscles fatigue quickly and the maximum power output is small. To optimize the use of existing stimulation-powered ergometers and improve the design of future systems, it is helpful to understand how the forces generated by the electrically stimulated muscles interact with the skeletal-ergometer linkage to drive the crank. Specifically, the question addressed in this dissertation is: Can performance be improved by changing either the configuration of the patient in the ergometer, the load being driven by the stimulation, or the timing of the stimulation? Performance is assessed in terms of the strength needed to produce a given motion, as well as in terms of the metabolic energy used. To achieve this goal, models were developed to represent: (1) the segmental dynamics of the lower limbs and their interaction with the ergometer, (2) the relationship between the stimulation and the force developed in the muscles, (3) the geometry of the interface between the muscles and the skeleton, (4) the control of the stimulation by the ergometer, and (5) the heat produced by the stimulated muscles. To gain confidence in the model of cycling ergometry, the model results were compared to the performance of a spinal cord injured subject pedaling Therapeutic Technology's ERGYS and to published average measurements of oxygen consumption under various loading conditions. A method was developed to quantify the strength required to pedal and the likelihood that a given individual will be able to maintain a steady-state cadence. In this way, the effect of ergometer modifications can be assessed without the knowledge of patient-specific muscular strength. Additionally, the relationship between strength and metabolic energy expended was explored. Based on these evaluations, possible strategies are suggested for decreasing the strength required to pedal, or increasing the cardiovascular exercise benefits of stimulation-induced leg cycle ergometry.},

  abstract  = {Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is a promising technique to artificially activate muscles as a means to potentially restore the capability to perform functional tasks in persons with neurological disorders. A pervasive problem with NMES is that overstimulation of the muscle (among other factors) leads to rapid muscle fatigue, which limits the use of clinical and commercial NMES systems. The objective of this paper is to develop an NMES controller that incorporates the effects of muscle fatigue during NMES-induced non-isometric contraction of the human quadriceps femoris muscle. Our previous work that used the RISE class of nonlinear controllers cannot accommodate fatigue and muscle activation dynamics. A totally new control design approach and associated stability proof is required to derive a new class of NMES control design that accounts for muscle fatigue dynamics and a first order activation dynamics, in addition to the second order musculoskeletal dynamics. Motivated from a control method for robotic systems in a strict-feedback form, a backstepping based nonlinear NMES controller was designed to accommodate for the additional muscle activation dynamics. Further, experimentally identified estimates of the fatigue and activation dynamics were incorporated in the control design. The developed controller uses a neural network-based estimate of the musculoskeletal dynamics and error due to fatigue estimation. A globally uniformly ultimately bounded stability is proven the new controller that accounts for an uncertain nonlinear muscle model and bounded nonlinear disturbances (e.g., spasticity, changing load dynamics). The developed controller was validated through experiments on the left and right legs of 3 able-bodied subjects and was compared with a proportional-derivative (PD) controller and a PD augmented with a neural network. The statistical analysis showed improved control performance compared to the PD controller.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES The development of neurorehabilitation technologies requires the profound understanding of the mechanisms underlying an individual's motor ability and impairment. A major factor limiting this understanding is the difficulty of bridging between events taking place at the neurophysiologic level (e.g., motor neuron firings) with those emerging at the musculoskeletal level (joint actuation), in vivo in the intact moving human. This review presents emerging modelbased methodologies for filling this gap that are promising for developing clinically viable technologies. METHODS We provide a design overview of musculoskeletal modeling formulations driven by recordings of neuromuscular activity with a critical comparison to alternative model-free approaches in the context of neurorehabilitation technologies. We present advanced electromyography-based techniques for interfacing with the human nervous system and model-based techniques for translating the extracted neural information into estimates of motor function. RESULTS We introduce representative application areas where modeling is relevant for accessing neuromuscular variables that could not be measured experimentally. We then show how these variables are used for designing personalized rehabilitation interventions, biologically inspired limbs, and human-machine interfaces. CONCLUSIONS The ability of using electrophysiological recordings to inform biomechanical models enables accessing a broader range of neuro-mechanical variables than analyzing electrophysiological data or movement data individually. This enables understanding the neuro-mechanical interplay underlying in vivo movement function, pathology and robot-assisted motor recovery. SIGNIFICANCE Filling the gap between our understandings of movement neural and mechanical functions is central for addressing one of the major challenges in neurorehabilitation: personalizing current technologies and interventions to an individual's anatomy and impairment.},

A flexible ankle joint for biped walking robots is proposed to investigate the influence of joint stiffness on motor's peak torque and energy consumption of the sagittal plane motion during the single support phase. Firstly, an improved model of the inverted pendulum is established, which is the theoretical foundation of the flexible ankle joint. Then the analysis of the analytic method of flexible joint is presented based on the improved model of the inverted pendulum. Finally, dynamic simulations of the flexible joint are performed to examine the correctness of analytic method. The results show that the flexible joint can reduce the joint motor's peak torque and energy consumption. Furthermore, there is an optimal joint stiffness of the flexible system, which can minimum peak torque with reduction of 45.99{\%} and energy consumption with reduction of 51.65{\%}.},

  abstract  = {Current electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal models are used to estimate joint moments measured from an individual's extremities during dynamic movement with varying levels of accuracy. The main benefit is the underlying musculoskeletal dynamics is simulated as a function of realistic, subject-specific, neural-excitation patterns provided by the EMG data. The main disadvantage is surface EMG cannot provide information on deeply located muscles. Furthermore, EMG data may be affected by cross-talk, recording and post-processing artifacts that could adversely influence the EMG's information content. This limits the EMG-driven model's ability to calculate the multi-muscle dynamics and the resulting joint moments about multiple degrees of freedom. We present a hybrid neuromusculoskeletal model that combines calibration, subject-specificity, EMG-driven and static optimization methods together. In this, the joint moment tracking errors are minimized by balancing the information content extracted from the experimental EMG data and from that generated by a static optimization method. Using movement data from five healthy male subjects during walking and running we explored the hybrid model's best configuration to minimally adjust recorded EMGs and predict missing EMGs while attaining the best tracking of joint moments. Minimally adjusted and predicted excitations substantially improved the experimental joint moment tracking accuracy than current EMG-driven models. The ability of the hybrid model to predict missing muscle EMGs was also examined. The proposed hybrid model enables muscle-driven simulations of human movement while enforcing physiological constraints on muscle excitation patterns. This might have important implications for studying pathological movement for which EMG recordings are limited.},

  abstract  = {Hand loss is a highly disabling event that markedly affects the quality of life. To achieve a close to natural replacement for the lost hand, the user should be provided with the rich sensations that we naturally perceive when grasping or manipulating an object. Ideal bidirectional hand prostheses should involve both a reliable decoding of the user's intentions and the delivery of nearly "natural" sensory feedback through remnant afferent pathways, simultaneously and in real time. However, current hand prostheses fail to achieve these requirements, particularly because they lack any sensory feedback. We show that by stimulating the median and ulnar nerve fascicles using transversal multichannel intrafascicular electrodes, according to the information provided by the artificial sensors from a hand prosthesis, physiologically appropriate (near-natural) sensory information can be provided to an amputee during the real-time decoding of different grasping tasks to control a dexterous hand prosthesis. This feedback enabled the participant to effectively modulate the grasping force of the prosthesis with no visual or auditory feedback. Three different force levels were distinguished and consistently used by the subject. The results also demonstrate that a high complexity of perception can be obtained, allowing the subject to identify the stiffness and shape of three different objects by exploiting different characteristics of the elicited sensations. This approach could improve the efficacy and "life-like" quality of hand prostheses, resulting in a keystone strategy for the near-natural replacement of missing hands.},

In the case of prosthetic limbs, existing neuromuscular interfaces have been unable to address this challenge and provide direct and intuitive neural control. Although prosthetic hardware and decoding algorithms are readily available, there is still a lack of appropriate and stable physiological signals for controlling the devices. We developed a percutaneous osseointegrated (bone-anchored) interface that allows for permanent and unlimited bidirectional communication with the human body. With this interface, an artificial limb can be chronically driven by implanted electrodes in the peripheral nerves and muscles of an amputee, outside of controlled environments and during activities of daily living, thus reducing disability and improving quality of life. We demonstrate in one subject, for more than 1 year, that implanted electrodes provide a more precise and reliable control than surface electrodes, regardless of limb position and environmental conditions, and with less effort. Furthermore, long-term stable myoelectric pattern recognition and appropriate sensory feedback elicited via neurostimulation was demonstrated. The opportunity to chronically record and stimulate the neuromuscular system allows for the implementation of intuitive control and naturally perceived sensory feedback, as well as opportunities for the prediction of complex limb motions and better understanding of sensory perception. The permanent bidirectional interface presented here is a critical step toward more natural limb replacement, by combining stable attachment with permanent and reliable human-machine communication.},

In the second step, muscle contraction dynamics characterize how muscle activations are transformed into muscle forces. The third step requires a model of the musculoskeletal geometry to transform muscle forces to joint moments. Finally, the equations of motion allow joint moments to be transformed into joint movements. Each step involves complex nonlinear relationships.

This transformation is complex, not only because the properties of muscles are complex, but because the tendon affects the transmission of muscle force to the skeleton. This review focuses on how to synthesize basic properties of muscle and tendon to construct models applicable to studies of coordination. After a review of the properties of muscle and tendon, their integrated ability to generate force statically and dynamically is studied by formulating a generic model of the "musculotendon actuator", which has only one parameter, the ratio of tendon length at rest to muscle fiber length at rest. To illustrate the utility of the model, it is analyzed to show how this one parameter specifies whether excitation-contraction or musculotendon contraction is the rate-limiting process of force generation, whether elastic energy is stored in tendon or muscle, and whether hip- and knee-extensor actuators function as springs or dashpots during walking.},

To achieve this goal, tendon forces and EMG-signals were recorded simultaneously in the gastrocnemius muscle of three cats while walking and trotting at different speeds on a motor-driven treadmill. The quality of the tendon force predictions were evaluated for three levels of generalization. First, at the intrasession level, tendon force predictions were made for step cycles from the same experimental session as the step cycles which were used to train the ANN. At this level of generalization very good results were obtained. Second, at the intrasubject level, tendon force predictions were made for one cat walking at a given speed while the ANN was trained with data from the same animal walking at different speeds. For the intrasubject predictions, the quality of the results depended on the walking speed for which the predictions were made: for the speeds at the low and high extremes, the predictions were worse than for the intermediate speeds. The cross-correlation coefficients between predicted and actual force time histories ranged from 0.78 to 0.91. Third, at the intersubject level, tendon forces were predicted for one animal walking at a given speed while the ANN was trained with data from the remaining two animals walking at the corresponding speed. The cross-correlation coefficients between predicted and actual force time histories ranged from 0.72 to 0.98. It was concluded that the ANN-approach is a powerful technique to predict dynamic tendon forces from EMG-signals.},

  abstract  = {EMG signals of dynamically contracting muscle have never been used to predict experimentally known muscle forces across subjects. Here, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) approach to first derive an EMG–force relationship from a subset of experimentally determined EMGs and muscle forces; second, we use this relationship to predict individual muscle forces for different contractile conditions and in subjects whose EMG and force data were not used in the derivation of the EMG–force relationship; and third, we validate the predicted muscle forces against the known forces recorded in vivo. EMG and muscle forces were recorded from the cat soleus for a variety of locomotor conditions giving a data base from three subjects, four locomotor conditions, and 8–16 steps per subject and condition. Considering the conceptual differences in the tasks investigated (e.g. slow walking vs. trotting), the intra-subject results obtained here are superior to those published previously, even though the approach did not require a muscle model or the instantaneous contractile conditions as input for the force predictions. The inter-subject results are the first of this kind to be presented in the literature and they typically gave cross-correlation coefficients between actual and predicted forces of {\textgreater}0.90 and root mean square errors of {\textless}15{\%}, thus they were considered excellent. From the results of this study, it was concluded that ANNs represent a powerful tool to capture the essential features of EMG–force relationships of dynamically contracting muscle, and that ANNs might be used widely to predict muscle forces based on EMG signals.},

  abstract  = {Optimization theory and other mathematical algorithms have traditionally been used to model the relationship between muscle activity and lower-limb dynamics during human gait. We introduce here an alternative approach, based on artificial neural networks with the back-propagation algorithm, to map two different transformations: (1) EMG → joint angles; and (2) EMG → joint moments. Normal data for 16 muscles and three joint moments and angles (hip, knee, and ankle) were adapted from the literature [Winter (1987), The Biomechanics and Motor Control of Human Gait]. Both networks were successfully trained to map the input vector onto the output vector. The models were tested by feeding in an input vector where all 16 muscles were slightly different (20{\%}) from the training data, and the predicted output vectors suggested that the models were valid. The trained networks were then used to perform two separate simulations: 30{\%} reduction in soleus activity; and removal of rectus femoris. Net 2, in which electromyography was mapped onto joint moments, provided the most reasonable results, suggesting that neural networks can provide a successful platform for both biomechanical modeling and simulation. We believe that this paper has demonstrated the potential of artificial neural networks, and that further efforts should be directed towards the development of larger training sets based on normal and pathological data.},

  abstract  = {Individuals following stroke exhibit altered muscle activation and movement patterns. Improving the efficiency of gait can be facilitated by knowing which muscles are affected and how they contribute to the pathological pattern. In this paper we present an electromyographically (EMG) driven musculoskeletal model to estimate muscle forces and joint moments. Subject specific EMG for the primary ankle plantar and dorsiflexor muscles, and joint kinematics during walking for four subjects following stroke were used as inputs to the model to predict ankle joint moments during stance. The model's ability to predict the joint moment was evaluated by comparing the model output with the moment computed using inverse dynamics. The model did predict the ankle moment with acceptable accuracy, exhibiting an average R2 value ranging between 0.87 and 0.92, with RMS errors between 9.7{\%} and 14.7{\%}. The values are in line with previous results for healthy subjects, suggesting that EMG-driven modeling in this population of patients is feasible. It is our hope that such models can provide clinical insight into developing more effective rehabilitation therapies and to assess the effects of an intervention.},

  abstract  = {Disorders of the human neuromusculoskeletal system such as osteoarthritis, stroke, cerebral palsy, and paraplegia significantly affect mobility and result in a decreased quality of life. Surgical and rehabilitation treatment planning for these disorders is based primarily on static anatomic measurements and dynamic functional measurements filtered through clinical experience. While this subjective treatment planning approach works well in many cases, it does not predict accurate functional outcome in many others. This paper presents a vision for how patient-specific multibody dynamic models can serve as the foundation for an objective treatment planning approach that identifies optimal treatments and treatment parameters on an individual patient basis. First, a computational paradigm is presented for constructing patient-specific multibody dynamic models. This paradigm involves a combination of patient-specific skeletal models, muscle-tendon models, neural control models, and articular contact models, with the complexity of the complete model being dictated by the requirements of the clinical problem being addressed. Next, three clinical applications are presented to illustrate how such models could be used in the treatment design process. One application involves the design of patient-specific gait modification strategies for knee osteoarthritis rehabilitation, a second involves the selection of optimal patient-specific surgical parameters for a particular knee osteoarthritis surgery, and the third involves the design of patient-specific muscle stimulation patterns for stroke rehabilitation. The paper concludes by discussing important challenges that need to be overcome to turn this vision into reality.},

  abstract  = {One proposed mechanism of patellofemoral pain, increased stress in the joint, is dependent on forces generated by the quadriceps muscles. Describing causal relationships between muscle forces, tissue stresses, and pain is difficult due to the inability to directly measure these variables in vivo. The purpose of this study was to estimate quadriceps forces during walking and running in a group of male and female patients with patellofemoral pain (n=27, 16 female; 11 male) and compare these to pain-free controls (n=16, 8 female; 8 male). Subjects walked and ran at self-selected speeds in a gait laboratory. Lower limb kinematics and electromyography (EMG) data were input to an EMG-driven musculoskeletal model of the knee, which was scaled and calibrated to each individual to estimate forces in 10 muscles surrounding the joint. Compared to controls, the patellofemoral pain group had greater co-contraction of quadriceps and hamstrings (p=0.025) and greater normalized muscle forces during walking, even though the net knee moment was similar between groups. Muscle forces during running were similar between groups, but the net knee extension moment was less in the patellofemoral pain group compared to controls. Females displayed 30–50{\%} greater normalized hamstring and gastrocnemius muscle forces during both walking and running compared to males (p{\textless}0.05). These results suggest that some patellofemoral pain patients might experience greater joint contact forces and joint stresses than pain-free subjects. The muscle force data are available as supplementary material.},

We then developed a novel and comprehensive EMG-driven model of the human lower extremity that used EMG signals from 16 muscle groups to drive 34 MTUs and satisfy the resulting joint moments simultaneously produced about four DOFs during different motor tasks. This also led to the development of a calibration procedure that allowed identifying a set of subject-specific parameters that ensured physiological behavior for the 34 MTUs. Results showed that currently available single-DOF models did not provide the same unique MTU force solution for the same input data. On the other hand, the MTU force solution predicted by our proposed multi-DOF model satisfied joint moments about multiple DOFs without loss of accuracy compared to single-DOF models corresponding to each of the four DOFs. The predicted MTU force solution was (1) a function of experimentally measured EMGs, (2) the result of physiological MTU excitation, (3) reflected different MTU contraction strategies associated to different motor tasks, (4) coordinated a greater number of MTUs with respect to currently available single-DOF models, and (5) was not specific to an individual DOF dynamics. Therefore, our proposed methodology has the potential of producing a more dynamically consistent and generalizable MTU force solution than was possible using single-DOF EMG-driven models. This will help better address the important scientific questions previously approached using single-DOF EMG-driven modeling. Furthermore, it might have applications in the development of human-machine interfaces for assistive devices.},

The EMG-driven musculoskeletal model estimates musculotendon and resulting joint stiffness that is consistent with experimental EMG data as well as with the experimental joint moments. This provides a framework that allows for the first time observing (1) the elastic interplay between the knee and ankle joints (2) the individual muscle contribution to joint stiffness, and (3) the underlying co-contraction strategies. It provides a theoretical description of how stiffness modulates as a function of muscle activation, fiber contraction, and interacting tendon dynamics. Furthermore, it describes how this differs from currently available stiffness definitions including quasi-stiffness and short-range stiffness.

However, tibiofemoral contact force predictions are influenced by many factors including muscle forces and anatomical representations of the knee joint. This study aimed to investigate the influence of subject-specific geometry and knee joint kinematics on the prediction of tibiofemoral contact forces using a calibrated EMG-driven neuromusculoskeletal model of the knee. One participant fitted with an instrumented total knee replacement walked at a self-selected speed while medial and lateral tibiofemoral contact forces, ground reaction forces, whole-body kinematics, and lower-limb muscle activity were simultaneously measured. The combination of generic and subject-specific knee joint geometry and kinematics resulted in four different OpenSim models used to estimate muscle–tendon lengths and moment arms. The subject-specific geometric model was created from CT scans and the subject-specific knee joint kinematics representing the translation of the tibia relative to the femur was obtained from fluoroscopy. The EMG-driven model was calibrated using one walking trial, but with three different cost functions that tracked the knee flexion/extension moments with and without constraint over the estimated joint contact forces. The calibrated models then predicted the medial and lateral tibiofemoral contact forces for five other different walking trials. The use of subject-specific models with minimization of the peak tibiofemoral contact forces improved the accuracy of medial contact forces by 47{\%} and lateral contact forces by 7{\%}, respectively compared with the use of generic musculoskeletal model.},

We evaluated the role of muscle properties in the regulation of endpoint stiffness by incorporating scalable models of muscle stiffness into a three-dimensional musculoskeletal model of the human arm. Two classes of muscle models were tested: one characterizing short-range stiffness and two estimating stiffness from the slope of the force-length curve.

  abstract  = {Large knee adduction moments during gait have been implicated as a mechanical factor related to the progression and severity of tibiofemoral osteoarthritis and it has been proposed that these moments increase the load on the medial compartment of the knee joint. However, this mechanism cannot be validated without taking into account the internal forces and moments generated by the muscles and ligaments, which cannot be easily measured. Previous musculoskeletal models suggest that the medial compartment of the tibiofemoral joint bears the majority of the tibiofemoral load, with the lateral compartment unloaded at times during stance. Yet these models did not utilise explicitly measured muscle activation patterns and measurements from an instrumented prosthesis which do not portray lateral compartment unloading. This paper utilised an EMG-driven model to estimate muscle forces and knee joint contact forces during healthy gait. Results indicate that while the medial compartment does bear the majority of the load during stance, muscles provide sufficient stability to counter the tendency of the external adduction moment to unload the lateral compartment. This stability was predominantly provided by the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemii muscles, although the contribution from the tensor fascia latae was also significant. Lateral compartment unloading was not predicted by the EMG-driven model, suggesting that muscle activity patterns provide useful input to estimate muscle and joint contact forces.},

  abstract  = {Various rehabilitation robots have been employed to recover the motor function of stroke patients. To improve the effect of rehabilitation, robots should promote patient participation and provide compliant assistance. This paper proposes an adaptive admittance control scheme (AACS) consisting of an admittance filter, inner position controller, and electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal model (EDMM). The admittance filter generates the subject's intended motion according to the joint torque estimated by the EDMM. The inner position controller tracks the intended motion, and its parameters are adjusted according to the estimated joint stiffness. Eight healthy subjects were instructed to wear the ankle exoskeleton robot, and they completed a series of sinusoidal tracking tasks involving ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. The robot was controlled by the AACS and a non-adaptive admittance control scheme (NAACS) at four fixed parameter levels. The tracking performance was evaluated using the jerk value, position error, interaction torque, and EMG levels of the tibialis anterior (TA) and gastrocnemius (GAS). For the NAACS, the jerk value and position error increased with the parameter levels, and the interaction torque and EMG levels of the TA tended to decrease. In contrast, the AACS could maintain a moderate jerk value, position error, interaction torque, and TA EMG level. These results demonstrate that the AACS achieves a good tradeoff between accurate tracking and compliant assistance because it can produce a real-time response to stiffness changes in the ankle joint. The AACS can alleviate the conflict between accurate tracking and compliant assistance and has potential for application in robot-assisted rehabilitation.},

Many muscle activation models can be found in the literature, but no comparison is available to guide the community on limitations and improvements. In this research, an EMG-driven elbow motion model is developed for the purpose of evaluating muscle activation models. Seven muscle activation models are used in an optimization procedure to determine which model has the best performance. Root mean square errors in muscle torque estimation range from 1.67–2.19 Nm on average over varying input trajectories. The computational resource demand was also measured during the optimization procedure, as it is an important aspect for determining if a model is feasible for use in a particular wearable assistive device.

  abstract  = {PURPOSE
This study aimed to (1) document patterns of quadriceps muscle wasting in the first 10 days of admission and (2) determine the relationship between muscle ultrasonography and volitional measures. 

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Twenty-two adults ventilated for more than 48 hours were included. Sequential quadriceps ultrasound images were obtained over the first 10 days and at awakening and intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Muscle strength and function were assessed at awakening and ICU discharge. 

RESULTS
A total of 416 images were analyzed. There was a 30{\%} reduction in vastus intermedius (VI) thickness, rectus femoris (RF) thickness, and cross-sectional area within 10 days of admission. Muscle echogenicity scores increased for both RF and VI muscles by +12.7{\%} and +25.5{\%}, respectively (suggesting deterioration in muscle quality). There was a strong association between function and VI thickness (r = 0.82) and echogenicity (r = −0.77). There was a moderate association between function and RF cross-sectional area (r = 0.71). 

CONCLUSIONS
Muscle wasting occurs rapidly in the ICU setting. Ultrasonography is a useful surrogate measure for identifying future impairment. Vastus intermedius may be an important muscle to monitor in the future because it demonstrated the greatest change in muscle quality and had the strongest relationship to volitional measures.},

  abstract  = {Muscle ultrasound is emerging as a promising tool in the diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases. The current observational study evaluates the usefulness of muscle ultrasound in patients with severe sepsis for assessment of critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy (CINM) in the intensive care unit. 28 patients with either septic shock or severe sepsis underwent clinical neurological examinations, muscle ultrasound, and nerve conduction studies on days 4 and 14 after onset of sepsis. 26 healthy controls of comparable age underwent clinical neurological evaluation and muscle ultrasound only. 26 of the 28 patients exhibited classic electrophysiological characteristics of CINM, and all showed typical clinical signs. Ultrasonic echogenicity of muscles was graded semiquantitatively and fasciculations were evaluated in muscles of proximal and distal arms and legs. 75{\%} of patients showed a mean echotexture greater than 1.5, which was the maximal value found in the control group. A significant difference in mean muscle echotexture between patients and controls was found at day 4 and day 14 (both p {\textless} 0.001). In addition, from day 4 to day 14, the mean grades of muscle echotexture increased in the patient group, although the values did not reach significance levels (p = 0.085). Controls revealed the lowest number of fasciculations. In the patients group, fasciculations were detected in more muscular regions (lower and upper arm and leg) in comparison to controls (p = 0.08 at day 4 and p = 0.002 at day 14). Muscle ultrasound represents an easily applicable, non-invasive diagnostic tool which adds to neurophysiological testing information regarding morphological changes of muscles early in the course of sepsis. Muscle ultrasound could be useful for screening purposes prior to subjecting patients to more invasive techniques such as electromyography and/or muscle biopsy. German Clinical Trials Register,

Thirty-one healthy elderly men (65.5±5.0) participated in this study. Echo intensity of rectus femoris and quadriceps femoris muscle thicknesses was determined by ultrasound images. Lower-body isometric and isokinetic peak torques (60, 180 and 360°.s−1), as well as rate of force development were evaluated as strength parameters. In addition, torque per unit of muscle mass was evaluated by the quotient between isometric peak torque of the knee extensors and the quadriceps femoris muscle thickness. The peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak), maximum aerobic workload (Wm{\'{a}}x), absolute (VT1 and VT2) ventilatory thresholds, as well as workloads at VT1 and VT2 (WVT1 and WVT2) were evaluated during a maximal incremental test on a cycle ergometer. There were significant negative correlations between the individual values of echo intensity with the corresponding individual values of isometric and isokinetic peak torques (60, 180 and 360°.s−1) (r=−0.48 to r=−0.64; P{\textless}0.05), as well as with WVT1 (r=−0.46) and WVT2 (r=−0.50) (P{\textless}0.05). In addition, significant positive correlations were observed between torque per unit of muscle mass and cardiovascular parameters (r=0.52 to r=0.60; P{\textless}0.001). The present results suggest that the echo intensity analysis using computer-aided gray-scale analysis is a low cost, easily accessible, and a safe method to evaluate the muscle quality, and may contribute to the research of neuromuscular and cardiovascular performances in the elderly.},

Ultrasonography (US) scans of four muscles (biceps brachii, forearm flexors, quadriceps femoris, anterior tibial muscle) were made in 76 children. All images were visually evaluated using the Heckmatt criteria and quantitatively evaluated with computer-assisted grey-scale analysis of muscle echo intensity. Visual evaluation could achieve a sensitivity up to 71{\%}, with a specificity of 92{\%}. With quantification, a sensitivity of 87{\%} accompanied by a specificity of 67{\%} was found, but other diagnostic values could be achieved, depending on the cut-off point. Quantification resulted in a higher interobserver agreement (kappa 0.86) compared with visual evaluation (kappa 0.53). We conclude that quantification of echo intensity is a more objective and accurate method. Because it can achieve higher sensitivities, it is better-suited for the screening task in the diagnostic phase of children with a NMD. (E-mail: s.pillen@cukz.umcn.nl)},

When force cannot be measured directly, due to a particular muscle being one of a functional group or because of pain, size measurements may be the only option.

Procedures for scanning and measuring semispinalis capitis and the deep posterior neck muscles (semispinalis cervicis, multifidus and rotatores) using ultrasound imaging are described and normal data provided on size, shape and symmetry of these muscles from a sample of 99 healthy subjects (46 males aged 20–72 years and 53 females aged 18–70 years). Significant gender differences were found (P{\textless}0.001) but muscle size did not alter significantly with age. Between-side symmetry can be used to assess abnormality of the deep neck muscle group but not semispinalis capitis. A regression equation is provided for predicting the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the deep neck muscles from spinous process length in males. Clinically, linear measurements can be used to predict the neck muscle CSAs (r=0.66–0.84, P{\textless}0.001). The method described for assessing the neck muscles is a potentially valuable tool in clinical practice.},

The patients were assessed before the control period, after the control period, and after the treatment period. Setting: Nineteen patients were recruited from physiotherapy departments in the Glasgow area; 2 subsequently dropped out before the treatment period. Patients: All patients had hemiplegia as a result of a cerebro-vascular accident (CVA) and were greater than 3 months but less than 36 months post-CVA. Average time since stroke was 7 months. Main Outcome Measures: The patients' gait was assessed over smooth linoleumf, carpet and uneven ground. Gait was evaluated using a switch-based portable system. Outcome measures were the temporal gait parameters of speed, symmetry, heel strike, and foot inversion during stance. The gait evaluation was repeated on 5 separate days at each assessment. The Barthel Index was applied at each session. Results: There was a significant orthotic improvement in inversion on all surfaces and for symmetry on linoleum (ANOVA, p = .05. There was no significant improvement in patients' gait when not using the PS. There was a significant improvement in the Barthel Index over the treatment period (Wilcoxon, p = .05).

The purposes of this study were to quantify joint moments while healthy subjects adapted to a robotic ankle exoskeleton and to determine if the period of motor adaptation is dependent on the magnitude of robotic assistance. The pneumatically powered ankle exoskeleton provided plantar flexor torque controlled by the wearer's soleus electromyography (EMG). Eleven na{\"{i}}ve individuals completed two 30-min sessions walking on a split-belt instrumented treadmill at 1.25m/s while wearing the ankle exoskeleton. After two sessions of practice, subjects reduced their soleus EMG activation by ∼36{\%} and walked with total ankle moment patterns similar to their unassisted gait (r2=0.98±0.02, THSD, p{\textgreater}0.05). They had substantially different ankle kinematic patterns compared to their unassisted gait (r2=0.79±0.12, THSD, p{\textless}0.05). Not all of the subjects reached a steady-state gait pattern within the two sessions, in contrast to a previous study using a weaker robotic ankle exoskeleton (Gordon and Ferris, 2007). Our results strongly suggest that humans aim for similar joint moment patterns when walking with robotic assistance rather than similar kinematic patterns. In addition, greater robotic assistance provided during initial use results in a longer adaptation process than lesser robotic assistance.},

Ten healthy subjects walked while wearing a pneumatically powered ankle exoskeleton on one limb that effectively increased plantar flexor strength of the soleus muscle. Soleus electromyography amplitude controlled plantar flexion assistance from the exoskeleton in real time. We hypothesized that subjects' gait kinematics would be initially distorted by the added exoskeleton power, but that subjects would reduce soleus muscle recruitment with practice to return to gait kinematics more similar to normal. We also examined the ability of subjects to recall their adapted motor pattern for exoskeleton walking by testing subjects on two separate sessions, 3 days apart. The mechanical power added by the exoskeleton greatly perturbed ankle joint movements at first, causing subjects to walk with significantly increased plantar flexion during stance. With practice, subjects reduced soleus recruitment by ∼35{\%} and learned to use the exoskeleton to perform almost exclusively positive work about the ankle. Subjects demonstrated the ability to retain the adapted locomotor pattern between testing sessions as evidenced by similar muscle activity, kinematic and kinetic patterns between the end of the first test day and the beginning of the second. These results demonstrate that robotic exoskeletons controlled by muscle activity could be useful tools for testing neural mechanisms of human locomotor adaptation.},

Eight dose-matched physical therapy sessions were provided to both groups during the first 6 weeks of the trial. Results—There was significant improvement within both groups from baseline to 30 weeks in comfortable gait speed (95{\%} confidence interval for mean change, 0.11–0.17 m/s for FDS and 0.12–0.18 m/s for AFO) and fast gait speed. However, no significant differences in gait speed were found in the between-group comparisons. Secondary outcomes (standard me...},

  abstract  = {Stroke significantly affects thousands of individuals annually, leading to considerable physical impairment and functional disability. Gait is one of the most important activities of daily living affected in stroke survivors. Recent technological developments in powered robotics exoskeletons can create powerful adjunctive tools for rehabilitation and potentially accelerate functional recovery. Here, we present the development and evaluation of a novel lower limb robotic exoskeleton, namely H2 (Technaid S.L., Spain), for gait rehabilitation in stroke survivors. H2 has six actuated joints and is designed to allow intensive overground gait training. An assistive gait control algorithm was developed to create a force field along a desired trajectory, only applying torque when patients deviate from the prescribed movement pattern. The device was evaluated in 3 hemiparetic stroke patients across 4 weeks of training per individual (approximately 12 sessions). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Houston. The main objective of this initial pre-clinical study was to evaluate the safety and usability of the exoskeleton. A Likert scale was used to measure patient's perception about the easy of use of the device. Three stroke patients completed the study. The training was well tolerated and no adverse events occurred. Early findings demonstrate that H2 appears to be safe and easy to use in the participants of this study. The overground training environment employed as a means to enhance active patient engagement proved to be challenging and exciting for patients. These results are promising and encourage future rehabilitation training with a larger cohort of patients. The developed exoskeleton enables longitudinal overground training of walking in hemiparetic patients after stroke. The system is robust and safe when applied to assist a stroke patient performing an overground walking task. Such device opens the opportunity to study means to optimize a rehabilitation treatment that can be customized for individuals.

  abstract  = {Robotic and functional electrical stimulation (FES) approaches are used for rehabilitation of walking impairment of spinal cord injured individuals. Although devices are commercially available, there are still issues that remain to be solved. Control of hybrid exoskeletons aims at blending robotic exoskeletons and electrical stimulation to overcome the drawbacks of each approach while preserving their advantages. Hybrid actuation and control have a considerable potential for walking rehabilitation but there is a need of novel control strategies of hybrid systems that adequately manage the balance between FES and robotic controllers. Combination of FES and robotic control is a challenging issue, due to the non-linear behavior of muscle under stimulation and the lack of developments in the field of hybrid control. In this article, a cooperative control strategy of a hybrid exoskeleton is presented. This strategy is designed to overcome the main disadvantages of muscular stimulation: electromechanical delay and change in muscle performance over time, and to balance muscular and robotic actuation during walking. Experimental results in healthy subjects show the ability of the hybrid FES-robot cooperative control to balance power contribution between exoskeleton and muscle stimulation. The robotic exoskeleton decreases assistance while adequate knee kinematics are guaranteed. A new technique to monitor muscle performance is employed, which allows to estimate muscle fatigue and implement muscle fatigue management strategies. Kinesis is therefore the first ambulatory hybrid exoskeleton that can effectively balance robotic and FES actuation during walking. This represents a new opportunity to implement new rehabilitation interventions to induce locomotor activity in patients with paraplegia.

  abstract = {The generation of muscle-actuated simulations that accurately represent the movement of old adults requires a model that accounts for changes in muscle properties that occur with aging. An objective of this study was to adjust the parameters of Hill-type musculo-tendon models to reflect nominal age-related changes in muscle mechanics that have been reported in the literature. A second objective was to determine whether using the parametric adjustments resulted in simulated dynamic ankle torque behavior similar to that seen in healthy old adults. The primary parameter adjustment involved decreasing maximum isometric muscle forces to account for the loss of muscle mass and specific strength with age. A review of the literature suggested the need for other modest adjustments that account for prolonged muscular deactivation, a reduction in maximum contraction velocity, greater passive muscle stiffness and increased normalized force capacity during lengthening contractions. With age-related changes incorporated, a musculo-tendon model was used to simulate isometric and isokinetic contractions of ankle plantarflexor and dorsiflexor muscles. The model predicted that ankle plantarflexion power output during 120 deg/s shortening contractions would be over 40{\%} lower in old adults compared to healthy young adults. These power losses with age exceed the 30{\%} loss in isometric strength assumed in the model but are comparable to 39-44{\%} reductions in ankle power outputs measured in healthy old adults of approximately 70 years of age. Thus, accounting for age-related changes in muscle properties, other than decreased maximum isometric force, may be particularly important when simulating movements that require substantial power development.},

  abstract = {Exoskeleton robots are promising assistive/rehabilitative devices that can help people with force deficits or allow the recovery of patients who have suffered from pathologies such as stroke. The key component that allows the user to control the exoskeleton is the human machine interface (HMI). Setting the HMI at the neuro-muscular level may lead to seamless integration and intuitive control of the exoskeleton arm as a natural extension of the human body. At the core of the exoskeleton HMI there is a model of the human muscle, the "myoprocessor," running in real-time and in parallel to the physiological muscle, that predicts joint torques as a function of the joint kinematics and neural activation levels. This paper presents the development of myoprocessors for the upper limb based on the Hill phenomenological muscle model. Genetic algorithms are used to optimize the internal parameters of the myoprocessors utilizing an experimental database that provides inputs to the model and allows for performance assessment. The results indicate high correlation between joint moment predictions of the model and the measured data. Consequently, the myoprocessor seems an adequate model, sufficiently robust for further integration into the exoskeleton control system},

A real-time, 3-D, musculoskeletal model of the upper limb has been developed for use in a simulation environment to allow such testing to be carried out noninvasively. The model provides real-time feedback of human arm dynamics that can be displayed to the user in a virtual reality environment. The model has a 3-DOF glenohumeral joint as well as elbow flexion/extension and pronation/supination and contains 22 muscles of the shoulder and elbow divided into multiple elements. The model is able to run in real time on modest desktop hardware and demonstrates that a large-scale, 3-D model can be made to run in real time. This is a prerequisite for a real-time, whole-arm model that will form part of a dynamic arm simulator for use in the development, testing, and user training of neural prosthesis systems.},

According to the scientific community, one of the keys to improve the situation is multi-modal sensing, i.e., using diverse sensor modalities to interpret the subject's intent and improve the reliability and safety of the control system in daily life activities. In this work, we first describe and test a novel wireless, wearable force- and electromyography device; through an experiment conducted on ten intact subjects, we then compare the obtained signals both qualitatively and quantitatively, highlighting their advantages and disadvantages. Our results indicate that force-myography yields signals which are more stable across time during whenever a pattern is held, than those obtained by electromyography. We speculate that fusion of the two modalities might be advantageous to improve the reliability of myocontrol in the near future.},

Various signal analysis methods are compared by illustrating their applicability in real-time settings.

For feature extraction, the probability density function (PDF) of EMG signals will be the main interest of this study.

  abstract  = {Peripheral nerves are exposed to mechanical stress during movement. However the in vivo mechanical properties of nerves remain largely unexplored. The primary aim of this study was to characterize the effect of passive dorsiflexion on sciatic nerve shear wave velocity (an index of stiffness) when the knee was in 90° flexion (knee 90°) or extended (knee 180°). The secondary aim was to determine the effect of five repeated dorsiflexions on the nerve shear wave velocity. Nine healthy participants were tested. The repeatability of sciatic nerve shear wave velocity was good for both knee 90° and knee 180° (ICCs≥0.92, CVs≤8.1{\%}). The shear wave velocity of the sciatic nerve significantly increased (p{\textless}0.0001) during dorsiflexion when the knee was extended (knee 180°), but no changes were observed when the knee was flexed (90°). The shear wave velocity–angle relationship displayed a hysteresis for knee 180°. Although there was a tendency for the nerve shear wave velocity to decrease throughout the repetition of the five ankle dorsiflexions, the level of significance was not reached (p=0.055). These results demonstrate that the sciatic nerve stiffness can be non-invasively assessed during passive movements. In addition, the results highlight the importance of considering both the knee and the ankle position for clinical and biomechanical assessment of the sciatic nerve. This non-invasive technique offers new perspectives to provide new insights into nerve mechanics in both healthy and clinical populations (e.g., specific peripheral neuropathies).},

  abstract = {Research on robotic exoskeletons has rapidly expanded over the previous decade. Advances in robotic hardware and energy supplies have enabled viable prototypes for human testing. This review paper describes current lower limb robotic exoskeletons, with specific regard to common trends in the field. The preponderance of published literature lacks rigorous quantitative evaluations of exoskeleton performance, making it difficult to determine the disadvantages and drawbacks of many of the devices. We analyzed common approaches in exoskeleton design and the convergence, or lack thereof, with certain technologies. We focused on actuators, sensors, energy sources, materials, and control strategies. One of the largest hurdles to be overcome in exoskeleton research is the user interface and control. More intuitive and flexible user interfaces are needed to increase the success of robotic exoskeletons. In the last section, we discuss promising future solutions to the major hurdles in exoskeleton control.

  abstract  = {Active upper-limb prostheses are used to restore important hand functionalities, such as grasping. In conventional approaches, a pattern recognition system is trained over a number of static grasping gestures. However, training a classifier in a static position results in lower classification accuracy when performing dynamic motions, such as reach-to-grasp. We propose an electromyography-based learning approach that decodes the grasping intention during the reaching motion, leading to a faster and more natural response of the prosthesis. Eight able-bodied subjects and four individuals with transradial amputation gave informed consent and participated in our study. All the subjects performed reach-to-grasp motions for five grasp types, while the elecromyographic (EMG) activity and the extension of the arm were recorded. We separated the reach-to-grasp motion into three phases, with respect to the extension of the arm. A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) on the muscular activity revealed significant differences among the motion phases. Additionally, we examined the classification performance on these phases. We compared the performance of three different pattern recognition methods; Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machines (SVM) with linear and non-linear kernels, and an Echo State Network (ESN) approach. Our off-line analysis shows that it is possible to have high classification performance above 80{\%} before the end of the motion when with three-grasp types. An on-line evaluation with an upper-limb prosthesis shows that the inclusion of the reaching motion in the training of the classifier importantly improves classification accuracy and enables the detection of grasp intention early in the reaching motion. This method offers a more natural and intuitive control of prosthetic devices, as it will enable controlling grasp closure in synergy with the reaching motion. This work contributes to the decrease of delays between the user's intention and the device response and improves the coordination of the device with the motion of the arm.},

  abstract = {Objective: Powered assistive devices need improved control intuitiveness to enhance their clinical adoption. Therefore, the intent of individuals should be identified and the device movement should adhere to it. Skeletal muscles contract synergistically to produce defined lower-limb movements so unique contraction patterns in lower-extremity musculature may provide a means of device joint control. Ultrasound (US) imaging enables direct measurement of the local deformation of muscle segments. Hence, the objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of using US to estimate human lower-limb movements. Methods: A novel algorithm was developed to calculate US features of the rectus femoris muscle during a non-weight-bearing knee flexion/extension experiment by 9 able-bodied subjects. Five US features of the skeletal muscle tissue were studied, namely, thickness, angle between aponeuroses, pennation angle, fascicle length, and echogenicity. A multiscale ridge filter was utilized to extract the structures in the image and a random sample consensus (RANSAC) model was used to segment muscle aponeuroses and fascicles. A localization scheme further guided RANSAC to enable tracking in an US image sequence. Gaussian process regression (GPR) models were trained using segmented features to estimate both knee joint angle and angular velocity. Results: The proposed segmentation-estimation approach could estimate knee joint angle and angular velocity with an average root mean square error value of 7.45 degrees and 0.262 rad/s, respectively. The average processing rate was 3-6 frames per second that is promising towards real-time implementation. Conclusion: Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using US to estimate human lower-extremity motion. The ability of algorithm to work in real- time may enable the use of US as a neural interface for lower-limb applications. Significance: Intuitive intent recognition of human lower-extremity movements using wearable US imaging, may enable volitional assistive device control, and enhance locomotor outcomes for those with mobility impairments.

However, despite their routine use, the accuracy with which Hill-type models predict the forces generated by muscles during submaximal, dynamic tasks remains largely unknown. This study compared human gastrocnemius forces predicted by Hill-type models with the forces estimated from ultrasound-based measures of tendon length changes and stiffness during cycling, over a range of loads and cadences. We tested both a traditional model, with one contractile element, and a differential model, with two contractile elements that accounted for independent contributions of slow and fast muscle fibres. Both models were driven by subject-specific, ultrasound-based measures of fascicle lengths, velocities and pennation angles and by activation patterns of slow and fast muscle fibres derived from surface electromyographic recordings. The models predicted, on average, 54{\%} of the time-varying gastrocnemius forces estimated from the ultrasound-based methods. However, differences between predicted and estimated forces were smaller under low speed–high activation conditions, with models able to predict nearly 80{\%} of the gastrocnemius force over a complete pedal cycle. Additionally, the predictions from the Hill-type muscle models tested here showed that a similar pattern of force production could be achieved for most conditions with and without accounting for the independent contributions of different muscle fibre types.},

Two aspects of the procedure were tested: (i) accounting for subject-specific AT stiffness and (ii) accounting for changes in the relative electromyographic (EMG) intensities of the three triceps surae muscles. Ten cyclists pedaled at 80rpm while a comprehensive set of kinematic, kinetic, EMG, and ultrasound data were collected. Subjects were tested at four crank loads, ranging from 14 to 44Nm (115 to 370W). AT forces during cycling were estimated from AT length changes and from AT stiffness, which we derived for each subject from ultrasound data and from plantar flexion torques measured during isometric tests. AT length changes were measured by tracking the muscle-tendon junction of the medial gastrocnemius (MG) relative to its insertion on the calcaneus. Because the relative EMG intensities of the triceps surae muscles varied with load during cycling, we divided subjects׳ measured AT length changes by a scale factor, defined as the square root of the relative EMG intensity of the MG, weighted by the fractional physiological cross-sectional areas of the three muscles, to estimate force. Subjects׳ estimated AT forces during cycling increased with load (p{\textless}0.05). On average, peak forces ranged from 920±96N (14Nm, 115W) to 1510±129N (44Nm, 370W). For most subjects, ankle moments derived from the ultrasound-based AT strains were 5–12{\%} less than the net ankle moments calculated from inverse dynamics (r2=0.71±0.28, RMSE=8.1±0.33Nm). Differences in the moments increased substantially when we did not account for changes in the muscles׳ relative EMG intensities with load or, in some subjects, when we used an average stiffness, rather than a subject-specific value. The proposed methods offer a non-invasive approach for studying in vivo muscle-tendon mechanics.},

  abstract  = {Muscle imaging is a promising field of research to understand the biological and bioelectrical characteristics of muscles through the observation of muscle architectural change. Sonomyography (SMG) is a technique which can quantify the real-time architectural change of muscles under different contractions and motions with ultrasound imaging. The pennation angle and fascicle length are two crucial SMG parameters to understand the contraction mechanics at muscle level, but they have to be manually detected on ultrasound images frame by frame. In this study, we proposed an automatic method to quantitatively identify pennation angle and fascicle length of gastrocnemius (GM) muscle based on multi-resolution analysis and line feature extraction, which could overcome the limitations of tedious and time-consuming manual measurement. The method started with convolving Gabor wavelet specially designed for enhancing the line-like structure detection in GM ultrasound image. The resulting image was then used to detect the fascicles and aponeuroses for calculating the pennation angle and fascicle length with the consideration of their distribution in ultrasound image. The performance of this method was tested on computer simulated images and experimental images in vivo obtained from normal subjects. Tests on synthetic images showed that the method could identify the fascicle orientation with an average error less than 0.1°. The result of in vivo experiment showed a good agreement between the results obtained by the automatic and the manual measurements (r=0.94±0.03; p{\textless}0.001, and r=0.95±0.02, p{\textless}0.001). Furthermore, a significant correlation between the ankle angle and pennation angle (r=0.89±0.05; p{\textless}0.001) and fascicle length (r=−0.90±0.04; p{\textless}0.001) was found for the ankle plantar flexion. This study demonstrated that the proposed method was able to automatically measure the pennation angle and fascicle length of GM ultrasound images, which made it feasible to investigate muscle-level mechanics more comprehensively in vivo.},

This delay in electromechanical coupling has been stated to be between 30 and 100 ms. Thus, in rapid movements it may be possible for electromyographic (EMG) activity to have terminated before force can be detected. This study was designed to determine the dependence of the EMG-tension delay upon selected initial conditions at the time of muscle activation. The right forearms of 14 subjects were passively oscillated by a motor-driven dynamometer through flexion-extension cycles of 135 deg at an angular velocity of approximately equal to 0.5 rad/s. Upon presentation of a visual stimulus the subjects maximally contracted the relaxed elbow flexors during flexion, extension, and under isometric conditions. The muscle length at the time of the stimulus was the same in all three conditions. An on-line computer monitoring surface EMG (Biceps and Brachioradialis) and force calculated the electromechanical delay. The mean value for the delay under eccentric condition, 49.5 ms, was significantly different (p less than 0.05) from the delays during isometric (53.9 ms) and concentric activity (55.5 ms). It is suggested that the time required to stretch the series elastic component (SEC) represents the major portion of the measured delay and that during eccentric muscle activity the SEC is in a more favorable condition for rapid force development.},

  abstract  = {BACKGROUND
This study was to extend previous neuromusculoskeletal modeling efforts through combining the in vivo ultrasound-measured musculotendon parameters on persons after stroke. 

METHOD
A subject-specific neuromusculoskeletal model of the elbow was developed to predict the individual muscle force during dynamic movement and then validated by joint trajectory. The model combined a geometrical model and a Hill-type musculotendon model, and used subject-specific musculotendon parameters as inputs. EMG signals and joint angle were recorded from healthy control subjects (n=4) and persons after stroke (n=4) during voluntary elbow flexion in a vertical plane. Ultrasonography was employed to measure the muscle optimal length and pennation angle of each prime elbow flexor (biceps brachii, brachialis, brachioradialis) and extensor (three heads of triceps brachii). Maximum isometric muscle stresses of the flexor and extensor muscle group were calibrated by minimizing the root mean square difference between the predicted and measured maximum isometric torque–angle curves. These parameters were then inputted into the neuromusculoskeletal model to predict the individual muscle force using the input of EMG signals directly without any trajectory fitting procedure involved. 

FINDINGS
The results showed that the prediction of voluntary flexion in the hemiparetic group using subject-specific parameters data was better than that using cadaveric data extracted from the literature. 

INTERPRETATION
The results demonstrated the feasibility of using EMG-driven neuromusculoskeletal modeling with direct ultrasound measurement for the prediction of voluntary elbow movement for both subjects without impairment and persons after stroke.},

  abstract  = {Neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) modeling is a valuable tool in orthopaedic biomechanics and motor control research. To evaluate the feasibility of using electromyographic (EMG) signals with NMS modeling to estimate individual muscle force during dynamic movement, an EMG driven NMS model of the elbow was developed. The model incorporates dynamical equation of motion of the forearm, musculoskeletal geometry and musculotendon modeling of four prime elbow flexors and three prime elbow extensors. It was first calibrated to two normal subjects by determining the subject-specific musculotendon parameters using computational optimization to minimize the root mean square difference between the predicted and measured maximum isometric flexion and extension torque at nine elbow positions (0–120° of flexion with an increment of 15°). Once calibrated, the model was used to predict the elbow joint trajectories for three flexion/extension tasks by processing the EMG signals picked up by both surface and fine electrodes using two different EMG-to-activation processing schemes reported in the literature without involving any trajectory fitting procedures. It appeared that both schemes interpreted the EMG somewhat consistently but their prediction accuracy varied among testing protocols. In general, the model succeeded in predicting the elbow flexion trajectory in the moderate loading condition but over-drove the flexion trajectory under unloaded condition. The predicted trajectories of the elbow extension were noted to be continuous but the general shape did not fit very well with the measured one. Estimation of muscle activation based on EMG was believed to be the major source of uncertainty within the EMG driven model. It was especially so apparently when fine wire EMG signal is involved primarily. In spite of such limitation, we demonstrated the potential of using EMG driven neuromusculoskeletal modeling for non-invasive prediction of individual muscle forces during dynamic movement under certain conditions.},

Dynamic measurements of human muscle fascicle length from sequences of B-mode ultrasound images have become increasingly prevalent in biomedical research. Manual digitisation of these images is time consuming and algorithms for automating the process have been developed. Here we present a freely available software implementation of a previously validated algorithm for semi-automated tracking of muscle fascicle length in dynamic ultrasound image recordings, “UltraTrack”. 

METHODS
UltraTrack implements an affine extension to an optic flow algorithm to track movement of the muscle fascicle end-points throughout dynamically recorded sequences of images. The underlying algorithm has been previously described and its reliability tested, but here we present the software implementation with features for: tracking multiple fascicles in multiple muscles simultaneously; correcting temporal drift in measurements; manually adjusting tracking results; saving and re-loading of tracking results and loading a range of file formats. 

RESULTS
Two example runs of the software are presented detailing the tracking of fascicles from several lower limb muscles during a squatting and walking activity. 

CONCLUSION
We have presented a software implementation of a validated fascicle-tracking algorithm and made the source code and standalone versions freely available for download.},

Muscle thickness, pennation angle and echogenicity of all muscles of musculus quadriceps were measured by M-US and correlated with isometric maximum voluntary contraction force (MVC) of musculus quadriceps. Reproducibility of M-US measurements as well as simple and multiple regression models were calculated. Of all measured M-US variables the highest reproducibility was found for measurements of thickness (intraclass correlation coefficients, 85-97{\%}). Simple regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation of thickness measurements of all muscles of musculus quadriceps with MVC in the elderly and in the young. Multiple regression analysis revealed that thickness of musculus vastus medialis had the best correlation with MVC in the elderly. This study showed that measurement of muscle thickness, especially of musculus vastus medialis, by M-US is a reliable, bedside method for monitoring the extent of sarcopenia.},

Studies have demonstrated that an increase in rectus femoris EI may affect physical performance. However, it is still unknown whether the whole quadriceps femoris EI (QEI) influences strength, power, and functional capacity of an older population. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the correlation between QEI, the four individual quadriceps portions EI, and muscular performance of older men. Fifty sedentary healthy men (66.1 ± 4.5 years, 1.75 ± 0.06 m, 80.2 ± 11.0 kg) volunteered for the present study. The QEI and EI of the four quadriceps portions were calculated by ultrasound imaging. Knee extension one repetition maximum (1RM), isometric peak torque (PT), and rate of torque development (RTD) were obtained as measures of muscular strength. Muscular power was determined by knee extension with 60 {\%} of 1RM and countermovement jump (CMJ). The 30-s sit-to-stand test was evaluated as a functional capacity parameter. QEI and all individual EI were correlated to functional capacity and power during CMJ (p ≤ 0.05), but rectus femoris EI was not related to knee extension average power (p {\textgreater} 0.05). There were significant correlations between all EI variables, 1RM, PT, and RTD at 0.2 s (p ≤ 0.05), but only vastus medialis EI and QEI were correlated to RTD at 0.05 s (p ≤ 0.05). The results of the present study suggest that QEI is related to muscular power and functional capacity of older subjects, but the EI of some individual quadriceps portions may underestimate the correlations with muscular performance. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Aging Association.},

  abstract  = {In this study, we examined the correlation between muscle ultrasound and muscle structure. Echo intensity (EI) of 14 muscles of two golden retriever muscular dystrophy dogs was correlated to the percentage interstitial fibrous tissue and fat in muscle biopsy. A significant correlation between interstitial fibrous tissue and EI was found (r = 0.87; p {\textless} 0.001). The separate influence of interstitial fat on muscle EI could not be established as only little fat was present. We conclude that fibrous tissue causes increased muscle EI. The high correlation between interstitial fibrous tissue and EI makes ultrasound a reliable method to determine severity of structural muscle changes. (E-mail: s.pillen@cukz.umcn.nl)},
